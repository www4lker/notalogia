# ChatGPT Is Coming for Classrooms. Don't Panic

The AI chatbot has stoked fears of an educational apocalypse. Some teachers see it as the reboot education sorely needs.

-   ChatGPT, a large language model, has raised concerns among educators that students may use it to cheat on their homework.
-   However, some teachers see ChatGPT as an opportunity to redesign the way learning looks like, and use it as a tool for enhancing critical thinking and learning.
-   Kelly Gibson, an English teacher, sees ChatGPT as a teaching tool and wants to incorporate it into her lessons.
-   ChatGPT is not intelligent in the way people are, it is a statistical machine that can sometimes regurgitate or create falsehoods, and needs guidance and further edits to get things right.
-   Gibson believes that she has a responsibility to bring ChatGPT into the classroom as it can widen the digital divide and disadvantage students who don’t have access.
-   Alex Taylor, researcher and teacher at City University of London, suggests that ChatGPT might bring attention to how the system of education is already broken.
-   Olya Kudina, teacher at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, advocates for teachers to “critically appropriate” the technology and find more creative ways to collaborate with it.
-   ChatGPT has the potential to disrupt education and create more work for teachers, and there are also student privacy implications to be considered.

**the AI - that it can widen the digital divide and disadvantage students who don’t have access**
>The use of AI in education can widen the digital divide by disproportionately benefitting students who have access to technology and internet access while leaving behind those who do not. This can further exacerbate existing disparities in educational opportunities and outcomes between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. For example, students from low-income families or rural areas may not have access to the same resources and technology as students from more affluent families or urban areas. As a result, they may not be able to fully participate in online learning or take advantage of AI-powered educational tools, putting them at a disadvantage. Additionally, students with disabilities or those who are not proficient in the language of instruction may also face barriers in using AI-based tools. It's important to consider these issues when implementing AI-based solutions and to work towards creating solutions that can be used by all students, regardless of their background or circumstances.

**"ChatGPT might bring attention to how the system of education is already broken"**

>There are a number of ways in which the current system of education is considered to be broken. Some of these include issues with access, equity, and quality. One major issue is that access to education is not universal, and there are many students who do not have access to the resources and opportunities that they need to succeed. This can include students from low-income families, students from rural areas, and students from minority groups. Another issue is that the current system is not always equitable, as students from different backgrounds may have vastly different experiences and opportunities. For example, students of color, students from low-income families, and students with disabilities are often disproportionately represented in lower-performing schools and are less likely to have access to advanced coursework and other opportunities. Additionally, the quality of education can be a concern, as many students may not be receiving the instruction and support they need to succeed. This can include issues with teacher quality, curriculum and resources, and student-teacher ratios. In this context, the use of AI in education may bring attention to these issues and underscore the fact that the system is already broken for many students. If AI is used in a way that further exacerbates these issues, it could widen the digital divide and disadvantage students who do not have access to the technology and resources needed to make use of it.


**“critically appropriate”** 
>"Critically appropriate" refers to the idea that teachers should not simply reject or blindly embrace ChatGPT, but instead critically evaluate the technology and find ways to use it in a responsible and effective way in the classroom. This approach involves considering the limitations and potential errors of the technology, as well as finding creative ways to collaborate with it. For example, students might use the chatbot to generate ideas or arguments, rather than rely on it as a source of information. Additionally, teachers can design assignments that draw from students' personal experiences, which ChatGPT would not be able to provide based on its training data. Overall, critically appropriating ChatGPT means using the technology in ways that enhance, not replace, learning and critical thinking.
