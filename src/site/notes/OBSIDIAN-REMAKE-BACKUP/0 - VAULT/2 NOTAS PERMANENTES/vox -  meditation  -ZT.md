**Main Insights of the Article:**

1. **Divergent Paths of Meditation**: Meditation in the Western mind is seen in two different ways. For some, it's a quick stress relief technique, often practiced with apps, while for others, it's a transformative pursuit leading to enlightenment. However, this dichotomy oversimplifies the diverse range of meditative experiences between stress relief and enlightenment.

2. **Mindfulness Industry and "McMindfulness"**: The mindfulness industry has gained momentum, focusing on stress reduction through techniques like breath awareness. This market is valued at millions of dollars, but critics argue that it oversimplifies meditation, addressing surface-level concerns without tackling deeper issues.

3. **New Direction in Meditation Research**: Recent researchers are discovering that meditation's transformative effects don't necessarily require years of practice. However, the current body of meditation research often overlooks this middle ground between stress relief and enlightenment.

4. **Advanced Meditation Research**: Some researchers are studying more profound meditative experiences under controlled conditions. New theoretical frameworks and tools, like machine learning models for analyzing brain activity, are reshaping meditation research towards understanding the mind's nature and potential transformation.

5. **Technological Advances and "Spirit Tech"**: Technological innovations, including brain stimulation and psychedelics, are being explored to accelerate advanced meditation experiences. This "spirit tech" aims to make profound meditative states more accessible and efficient.

6. **Challenges and Concerns**: The acceleration of meditation experiences raises concerns about potential adverse effects and whether shortcuts truly replicate the benefits of long-term practice. Balancing technological advancements with traditional meditative practices is a challenge.

7. **Contemplative Science and Bureaucracy**: The emerging field of contemplative science aims to foster deeper dialogue between clinical care, public health, and advanced meditative experiences. The goal is to integrate this knowledge into broader frameworks, including medical textbooks, diagnostic codes, and insurance reimbursement procedures.
