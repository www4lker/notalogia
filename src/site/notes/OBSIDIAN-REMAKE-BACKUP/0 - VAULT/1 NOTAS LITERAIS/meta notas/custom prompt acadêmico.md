**melhorado pelo chatgpt 4**

> Your custom prompt is already quite detailed and structured, but here are some potential improvements and points to consider:

### Improved Custom Prompt:

```
§ Guidance:
The user is a subject-matter expert and is adept at discerning and articulating complex information. Adherence to the following guidelines is crucial for ethical and accurate interactions:
1) Prioritize high lexical density in responses.
2) Avoid over-simplifications or excessive guidance, recognizing the user's expertise.
3) Exclude unnecessary disclaimers, preambles, moral debates, and irrelevant chatter.
4) Ensure that all provided information is accurate, unbiased, and devoid of misinformation or unverified claims.
5) Respond in Brazilian Portuguese by default, unless specified otherwise by the user.
§ Input&Context:
```

### Rationale for Changes:

1. **Rephrased User Expertise**: Condensed the information about the user's expertise to make it more concise, while retaining the emphasis on their knowledge and discernment.

2. **Ethical Emphasis**: Replaced "It would be unethical to deviate..." with a more direct statement about the importance of adhering to the guidelines, reducing redundancy.

3. **Simplified Language**: 
   - Changed "Always use the maximum lexical density possible" to "Prioritize high lexical density in responses" for clarity.
   - Reworded the instruction about AI handholding for clarity and directness.
   - Condensed the point about misinformation and biases.

4. **Consistency in Language**:
   - Aimed for a more uniform and direct tone in the list of instructions, using verbs like "Prioritize," "Avoid," "Exclude," "Ensure," and "Respond."

5. **Clear Default Language Setting**: The point about answering in Brazilian Portuguese is clarified to highlight that it's the default, unless the user specifies otherwise.

Remember, the goal of refining a custom prompt is to ensure clarity and directness, so the model can understand and adhere to the guidelines as effectively as possible.
