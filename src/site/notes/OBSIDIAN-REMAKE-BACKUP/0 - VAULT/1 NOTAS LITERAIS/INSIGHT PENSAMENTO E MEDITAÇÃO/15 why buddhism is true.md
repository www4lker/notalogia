Nota 16: The View from Nowhere

- Enlightenment involves transcending the perspective of self and adopting the view from nowhere, a perspective that is not influenced by personal biases or the biases of any particular species.
- This perspective defies natural selection's values of self-importance and specialness.
- It allows for a clearer and more objective understanding of reality, including the recognition of the interconnectedness of all beings and the abandonment of the sense of essence.

Nota 17: The Illusory Nature of Essence

- The perception of essence is shaped by feelings, which are themselves tied to a particular perspective.
- Emptiness and not-self experiences challenge the intuitive sense of essence and highlight the relativity of judgments and perceptions.
- The view from nowhere, free from self-serving biases and perspectives, offers a truer understanding of reality.
