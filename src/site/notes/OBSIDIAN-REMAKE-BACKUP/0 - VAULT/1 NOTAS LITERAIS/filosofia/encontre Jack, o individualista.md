# “Escreva um personagem tipo detetive hard boiled com a personalidade tipo 4 do eneagrama”

Meet Jack, an Enneagram type Four, "The Individualist," a private detective who has seen it all in the gritty streets of Los Angeles. He is a man of few words, but when he does speak, it's always with a hint of poetry in his voice. He is a man who has always been in touch with his emotions, and he is not afraid to let them guide him on his cases. He is not a traditional detective, he often takes on cases that others have deemed unsolvable, and he always finds a way to see the beauty in the darkest of situations.

Jack's office is a mess, but not just any mess. It's the type of mess that only a true artist can create, with papers and photos scattered everywhere, each one holding a clue to a case he's working on. His desk is an old wooden monstrosity, with a green glass ashtray and an old fashioned telephone on it. The walls are adorned with paintings, photographs, and posters, all of which hold a special meaning to Jack. In the corner of the room sits his guitar, a reminder of a life he left behind.

Jack is not one for the latest technology, he still prefers the good old fashioned ways of solving a case, a notebook, a pencil and a good intuition. He trusts his emotions over evidence, but that does not mean he overlooks the facts. He is a man of contradictions, strong yet vulnerable, tough yet sensitive.

When Jack takes on a case, he doesn't just solve it, he becomes a part of it, living and breathing it until it's solved. His clients are not just clients, they are people with emotions and feelings, and he can't help but empathize with them. He's not in it for the money, he's in it for the thrill of solving the puzzle, the rush of putting the pieces together.

He's a lone wolf, but he's not lonely, he's fiercely independent, but he craves deep, intense, emotionally open relationships. He's not afraid to take on the impossible cases, and he'll stop at nothing to get to the bottom of it, even if it means putting his own life on the line. He's a man who will always follow his heart, even if it leads him down a dangerous path.

Jack, the Individualist, is a detective like no other, a man who will always find the beauty in the darkest of cases and bring justice to the streets of Los Angeles.
