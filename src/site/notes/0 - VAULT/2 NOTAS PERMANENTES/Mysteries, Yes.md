> ##### **Mysteries, Yes  
> **_Mary Oliver_
> 
> Truly, we live with mysteries too marvelous  
>    to be understood.
> 
> How grass can be nourishing in the  
>    mouths of the lambs.  
> How rivers and stones are forever  
>    in allegiance with gravity  
>       while we ourselves dream of rising.  
> How two hands touch and the bonds will  
>    never be broken.  
> How people come, from delight or the  
>    scars of damage,  
> to the comfort of a poem.
> 
> Let me keep my distance, always, from those  
>    who think they have the answers.
> 
> Let me keep company always with those who say  
>    “Look!” and laugh in astonishment,  
>    and bow their heads.
