>Ancient Greek and Roman philosophers, such as Plato, Aristotle, Democritus, and Epicurus, envisioned the end of the world and debated about what form of apocalyptic catastrophe would befall humanity. They saw the end of the world as a natural process that was part of the regular functioning of the cosmos, rather than as a day of divine wrath and judgment. End-of-the-world narratives allowed for a form of time travel, offering a vision of the future while permitting the safe witnessing of the coming catastrophe. The ancient philosophical tradition lies beneath many contemporary visions of the future, such as The Road and The Walking Dead, which are more indebted to Plato’s theories than to Biblical apocalypses.

## Some readings for someone who liked The road (McCarthy) and The last of us, and the philosophic aspect of these

1. "The Plague" by Albert Camus - This novel explores the human condition and the meaning of life in the face of suffering and death. It raises questions about the nature of existence, morality, and the struggle to find meaning in a world that seems to lack it.
    
2. "The Postman" by David Brin - This post-apocalyptic novel is similar to "The Road" in its depiction of a world devastated by disaster. It also explores themes of hope, survival, and the power of storytelling to shape the way we view the world.
    
3. "The Road to Character" by David Brooks - This non-fiction book explores the idea of character and what it means to live a meaningful life. It examines the importance of moral values, relationships, and personal growth, and offers insights into how to develop a strong sense of purpose and meaning in life.
    
4. "The Last Man" by Mary Shelley - This novel explores the themes of loneliness and isolation in a world where humanity has been wiped out by a plague. It raises questions about the nature of humanity, the limits of science, and the importance of community and connection in our lives.
    
5. "The Myth of Sisyphus" by Albert Camus - This philosophical essay explores the idea of the absurdity of life and the struggle to find meaning in a world that seems indifferent to our existence. It offers insights into the human condition and the search for meaning and purpose in life.

These readings share similar themes to "The Road" and "The Last of Us," including survival, the struggle to find meaning in a harsh and unforgiving world, and the importance of human connections and relationships in our lives.
