## Academia Is the Alternative Career Path

## Why pretend otherwise?

The text is discussing the lack of permanent academic jobs for PhD graduates and postdoctoral researchers, and how the institutions and journals in academia have been discussing the need to prepare students for careers outside of academia. However, the author suggests that instead of framing it as a need to find alternatives to academia, **it should be made clear that academia itself is an alternative career path, as most PhD graduates and postdoctoral researchers will not find permanent jobs in academia.** The author also notes that different research fields have varying rates of converting PhDs into academics and that there are good career paths within universities that are not research-intensive and outside of academia, such as private sector research, journalism, and science communication. Additionally, the author states that obtaining a PhD can be a wonderful experience that provides many valuable skills, regardless of what career path one chooses to take.
