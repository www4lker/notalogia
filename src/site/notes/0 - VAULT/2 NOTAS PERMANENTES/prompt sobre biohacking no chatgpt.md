>write a critical essay on how transhumanism and the biohacker movement are in essence a side-effect of living in a capitalist era of exacerbated charging for productivity beyond limits; how the neoliberal constant has forced individuals to be executioners of themselves.

Transhumanism and the biohacker movement are a reflection of the capitalist era in which we live, where individuals are under constant pressure to be more productive and achieve success at all costs. In this neoliberal society, the human body and mind are seen as tools that need to be optimized and enhanced in order to be able to compete in the market.

The biohacker movement, which emerged from transhumanism, is a clear example of how the capitalist system has forced individuals to take matters into their own hands, literally, in order to improve their physical and mental capabilities. Biohackers use various methods such as supplements, genetic engineering, and wearable technology to enhance their performance, and often do so without any medical supervision. They are driven by the desire to be more productive and achieve success in their careers.

This pressure to be constantly productive is not new, but it has been exacerbated in recent years. The rise of the gig economy and the flexibility it offers has led to an increase in the number of people working more than one job and longer hours. At the same time, technology has made it possible to be constantly connected and available, leading to a blurring of the boundaries between work and leisure time.

The biohacker movement is a side effect of this constant charging for productivity beyond limits. The pressure to be constantly productive has led to individuals seeking ways to improve their performance, and the biohacker movement offers a DIY solution to this problem.
