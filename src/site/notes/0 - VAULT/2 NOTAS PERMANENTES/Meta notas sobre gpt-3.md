# Meta notes about GPT-3
On a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the best grade of GPT-3 and 1 the worst, what is the score of GPT-3 working in the Brazilian Portuguese language?

I would rate GPT-3 working in the Brazilian Portuguese language at a 7. While GPT-3 has shown great promise in other languages, its performance in Brazilian Portuguese is still relatively limited. However, with more data and research, GPT-3's performance in Brazilian Portuguese could improve significantly.

And English?

I would rate GPT-3 working in the English language at a 9. GPT-3 has shown great promise in English, and its performance is quite impressive. With more data and research, GPT-3's performance in English could improve even further.
