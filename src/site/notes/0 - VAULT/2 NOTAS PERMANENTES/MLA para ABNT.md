# converting Text from MLA to ABNT


>The MLA (Modern Language Association) and ABNT (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas) citation styles are widely used in academic writing, each with their own distinct formatting and referencing rules. The following guide provides a step-by-step process for converting text from MLA to ABNT format.

Step 1: Formatting

-   Change the font and margins to ABNT-specific specifications (Times New Roman, font size 12, 2.5 cm margins).
-   Insert page numbers in the header, aligned to the right.
-   Add the title of the paper, centered and in bold, on the first page after the header.
-   Add the author's name, in bold and centered, under the title.
-   Add the institutional affiliation, if any, under the author's name.
-   Add the abstract (summary of the paper), if required, on the second page.

Step 2: In-text Citations

-   Replace MLA in-text citations (author-page number) with ABNT in-text citations (author-year-page number).
-   Use parenthesis to enclose the citation information.

Step 3: Reference List

-   Replace the MLA Works Cited page with an ABNT Reference List.
-   List the sources in alphabetical order by the first author's last name.
-   Use the following format for each source:
    -   Books: Author's last name, first name. Title of the Book. Edition (if not the first). Place of publication: Publisher, year.
    -   Journal Articles: Author's last name, first name. "Title of the Article." Title of the Journal volume number (year): page numbers.
    -   Webpages: Author's last name, first name (if available). "Title of the Webpage." Name of the Website, publication date (if available), URL (accessed date).

1. Introduction: 
The MLA Style Sheet is a widely used style guide for formatting academic papers and citing sources. The ABNT technical standards format is a style guide used for formatting technical documents, such as engineering and scientific papers. Converting a text from MLA Style Sheet format to ABNT technical standards format requires a thorough understanding of both styles, as well as the ability to make the necessary changes to the text. 

2. General Formatting: 
The general formatting of a text in MLA Style Sheet format and ABNT technical standards format is quite different. **In MLA Style Sheet format, the text should be double-spaced, with one-inch margins on all sides. The font should be 12-point Times New Roman. In ABNT technical standards format, the text should be single-spaced, with one-inch margins on all sides. The font should be 10-point Arial.** 

3. Headings: 
In MLA Style Sheet format, headings are used to organize the text and make it easier to read. Headings should be in bold and should be numbered. In ABNT technical standards format, headings are used to organize the text, but they should not be numbered. Instead, headings should be in italics and should be followed by a colon. 

4. Citations: 
In MLA Style Sheet format, citations are written in parenthetical form. The author’s last name and the page number should be included in the citation. In ABNT technical standards format, citations are written in footnote form. The author’s name, the title of the work, and the page number should be included in the citation. 

5. Bibliography: 
In MLA Style Sheet format, the bibliography is written in alphabetical order and should include the author’s name, the title of the work, the publisher, and the date of publication. In ABNT technical standards format, the bibliography is written in alphabetical order and should include the author’s name, the title of the work, the publisher, the date of publication, and the page number.
