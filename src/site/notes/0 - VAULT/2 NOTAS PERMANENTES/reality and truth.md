> A realidade existe independentemente de nossos pensamentos e percepções, e nossas crenças são descrições e não partes da própria realidade. O capítulo explora diferentes visões filosóficas sobre a realidade, critica a teoria da correspondência da verdade e apresenta a teoria da coerência como uma alternativa. Conclui que não existem verdades absolutas e destaca a constante revisão de nossas crenças sobre a realidade e a verdade.

The chapter discusses the concepts of reality and truth. It argues that reality exists independently of our thoughts and perceptions, and that our beliefs are merely descriptions of reality. Objects, properties, and relations are inventions we use to describe reality, but they should not be considered part of reality itself. The chapter also explores different philosophical views on reality, such as realism, which holds that objects exist independently of our thoughts about them.

Regarding truth, the chapter criticizes the correspondence theory of truth, which states that a true statement is one that corresponds with reality. It argues that this definition is meaningless since objects and properties are part of our models of reality, not reality itself. The coherence theory of truth, which focuses on internal consistency among beliefs, is presented as an alternative.

The chapter concludes that there are no absolute truths. When people claim that something is absolutely true, it is merely an expression of their strong belief in that idea. Mathematical and logical truths are discussed, but these are considered to be based on specialized definitions of truth used in those fields. Ultimately, the chapter argues that our beliefs about reality and truth are constantly subject to revision.

1. Reality exists independently of our thoughts and perceptions: This insight highlights the distinction between our mental constructs and the world outside of our minds, emphasizing the inherent limitations of human comprehension and perception.

2. Objects, properties, and relations are inventions we use to describe reality: This insight emphasizes that our understanding of the world is filtered through our own conceptual frameworks, which we create to make sense of our experiences.

3. There are different philosophical views on reality, such as realism: This point demonstrates the diversity of thought on the nature of reality, encouraging readers to consider various perspectives and engage in philosophical inquiry.

4. Correspondence theory of truth is criticized as meaningless: This critique challenges the seemingly intuitive notion that true statements correspond to reality, prompting readers to think more deeply about the nature of truth and its relationship to reality.

5. Coherence theory of truth as an alternative: This theory suggests that internal consistency among beliefs is a more meaningful way to think about truth, emphasizing the importance of logical coherence in our understanding of the world.

6. There are no absolute truths: This insight underscores the fallibility of human knowledge and the constant potential for revision, encouraging humility and open-mindedness in the face of new information and perspectives.

7. Mathematical and logical truths are based on specialized definitions of truth: This point highlights that even seemingly objective fields like mathematics and logic are grounded in human-made concepts and systems, reinforcing the idea that our understanding of reality is always filtered through our own mental constructs.
