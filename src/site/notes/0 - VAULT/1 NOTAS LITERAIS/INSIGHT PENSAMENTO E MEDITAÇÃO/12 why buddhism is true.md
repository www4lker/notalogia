### Nota 1: Rethinking the Plantain Weed

- A meditation retreat led the author to question their hostility towards the plantain weed, seeing its beauty for the first time.
- The author realizes that the classification of a plant as a weed is subjective and lacks objective criteria.
- This experience resembles a brush with emptiness, as the essence of the weed seemed to diminish and become less distinguishable from other plants.

### Nota 2: Essence and Moral Psychology

- The perception of essence plays a crucial role in moral psychology and how we treat others.
- Our judgments of people's essence are often influenced by superficial factors, such as attractiveness.
- Moral judgments are often made based on a single data point, and we tend to attribute behavior to disposition rather than situational factors.
- The fundamental attribution error leads us to underestimate the role of situation and overestimate the role of disposition in explaining behavior.

### Nota 3: Essence-Preservation Mechanism

- Our brains have a mechanism, the essence-preservation mechanism, that allows us to maintain our perception of essence in the face of conflicting evidence.
- When enemies or rivals do something good, we attribute it to circumstance, whereas when close friends or allies do something bad, we also attribute it to circumstance.
- This mechanism helps maintain our enemy image and reinforces our beliefs about the essence of others.
- The mechanism is influenced by our need for justice and the satisfaction we derive from seeing evildoers suffer.

### Nota 4: The Illusion of Essence

- The perception of essence is a preconception programmed into our brain.
- By practicing mindfulness meditation, we can reduce our preconceptions and see things with less essence.
- This can lead to a clearer comprehension of the world and a greater sense of empathy and understanding.
- However, the reduction of essence is not guaranteed to make us better people, and moral instruction is still necessary to guide our actions.

### Nota 5: The Impact on Relationships

- Intensive meditation practice may alter the nature of our personal relationships.
- It may lead to less possessive love and a more equitable distribution of compassion.
- However, the effect of meditation on our relationships is not the only moral consideration.
- We should also reflect on how our practice affects our compassion for people broadly and whether it distances us from feelings of compassion altogether.

### Nota 6: The Joy of Life

- There is a concern that the practice of the dharma could take the joy out of life.
- Bhikkhu Bodhi argues that the Buddhist path enriches the emotional life and leads to greater happiness and joy.
- Mindfulness meditation allows us to choose which feelings to follow and weakens our obedience to them.
- This selective engagement with feelings can contribute to a freer and more joyful response to the world.
