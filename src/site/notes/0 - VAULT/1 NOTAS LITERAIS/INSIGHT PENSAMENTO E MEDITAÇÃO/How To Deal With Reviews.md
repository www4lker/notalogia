# How To Deal With Reviews 
>“…the paper strikes me as trivial and as an addition in the endless series of thrusts beyond unsettled frontiers.” — An anonymous referee for The Strength of Weak Ties by M. Granovetter, now a classic with over 50,000 citations

Saramäki, Jari. How To Write A Scientific Paper: An Academic Self-Help Guide for PhD Students (p. 97). Edição do Kindle. 

In a nutshell, when you receive the dreaded letter from the editor with referee comments, do the following: 
1) Breathe. Relax. Get a cup of coffee. 
2) Read the editor’s comments. Figure out if there is anything useful in there and do whatever the editor wants from you.
3) Read the referee comments slowly and analytically, first focusing on those that are useful: fixing flaws, carrying out extra experiments, backing up your claims with more conclusive evidence, being clearer. 
4) Read the rest of the referee comments with your psychologist hat on. What would make the referees happy? 
5) Fix flaws, carry out new experiments. Revise your paper accordingly. For every referee comment, change something in the manuscript. 
6) Write a rebuttal letter, thanking the editor and the referees for their comments. Respond politely and in detail to every comment, even the silly ones; if the referees are confused, act as if this was your fault. Tell them what you have changed in response to their comment (this can be just a single sentence). 
7) Make sure that the editor’s concerns are explicitly addressed in your rebuttal letter. 
8) Make sure that each and every referee comment is addressed in detail, including requests that you chose not to fulfil. Unlike the cover letter, the rebuttal letter does not need to be short. The longer and more detailed, the better.
9) Resubmit the paper and the rebuttal letter. Keep your fingers crossed.
