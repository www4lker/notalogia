Nota 8: Essence, Oneness, and Interdependence

- The perception of oneness and interdependence is closely connected to the experience of not-self.
- Buddhist philosophy emphasizes interdependent co-arising, where things are dependent on each other for their existence and lack inherent, independent existence.
- The ideas of emptiness and oneness are not as different as they may seem, as both point to the interconnectedness of all things.

Nota 9: Tanha and the Sense of Self

- Tanha, often translated as "thirst" or "craving," is tied to our sense of self and reinforces the idea of a separate and bounded self.
- Overcoming tanha is a key aspect of the not-self experience, both internally and in relation to the external world.
- Tanha fuels both attraction and aversion, which contribute to the perception of self and other.

Nota 10: Overcoming the Three Poisons

- The three poisons of greed, hatred, and delusion are closely connected to the not-self experience.
- Greed and hatred, driven by tanha, reinforce the sense of self and other.
- Overcoming these poisons involves eradicating tanha and the illusion of self, leading to liberation and a deeper understanding of emptiness and interconnectedness.
