### Failure

1.  Failure is a common experience in life, especially in sports.
2.  Examples of failure in baseball include "Merkle's Boner," the "Snodgrass Muff," and Bill Buckner's error.
3.  Ralph Branca is known for giving up the "Shot Heard 'Round the World."
4.  Failure is a universal experience, but some failures can have significant consequences, such as the failed experiments of the Levellers and Diggers in 17th century England.
5.  Failure can also be a learning opportunity and a chance to grow.
6.  The poet James Richardson and the artist Leonardo da Vinci both had failures in their lives and careers.
7.  The British historian Christopher Hill wrote a book about the failures of the Levellers and Diggers. 
8.  The idea that people narrate their lives and that this is important for living well is commonly accepted, but philosopher Galen Strawson disputes this idea.
9.  Strawson argues that not everyone sees their life as a narrative and that a good life does not necessarily have to be told as a coherent story by the subject.
10.  Examples of people whose lives do not fit a coherent narrative include Strawson himself, Iris Murdoch, Michel de Montaigne, and Bill Veeck.
11.  Narratives can be imposed on a person's life by others and may not accurately reflect the person's own experiences or perspectives.
12.  The idea of life as a narrative may be harmful if it leads people to feel like their life is a failure if it does not fit a certain narrative structure.
13. The idea of "seizing the day" and living in the present can be problematic if it leads to recklessness. 
14. Philosopher and novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel "The Idiot" reflects the open-ended, unpredictable nature of life.
15.  Dostoevsky's character Prince Myshkin is a "perfectly beautiful man" who is thrown into chaotic circumstances and does not have a clear plan or purpose.
16.  Myshkin's actions are guided by his character and principles, rather than by the desire for success or the avoidance of failure.
17.  The Bhagavad Gita advises to "abide in yoga" and engage in actions without clinging to the outcome or the desire to avoid failure.
18.  The idea of living in the present can be seen as a way to focus on activities that are not defined by success or failure, rather than trying to control the outcomes of projects.

1.  Many people believe that constructing and living by a narrative is a crucial part of living a good life.
2.  However, this is not necessarily true for everyone, as some people do not experience their lives as having a narrative structure or do not tell their own life stories.
3.  Distinguishing between two types of activities, "telic" activities that aim at a terminal state and "atelic" activities that do not, can help us understand how to live well in the present.
4.  Telic activities are important for achieving practical goals, but atelic activities, such as relationships and personal growth, are also valuable.
5.  Focusing on the process rather than the outcome can help us live a more fulfilling life, but it is also important to consider the consequences of our actions.
6.  The idea that living well requires a narrative structure is a fallacy, and we should strive to find a balance between telic and atelic activities that works for us as individuals.
-   The value of atelic activities (those without a terminal state) lies in the process, not the project
-   There is value in the struggle to do what is right as much as in the outcome
-   The Bhagavad Gita and Aristotle's philosophy also highlight the importance of atelic activities
-   The movie Groundhog Day can be interpreted as a meditation on the value of atelic activities
-   Atelic activities can provide insulation against failure, but they are not always available or easy to perform
-   Process can lead to personal growth and change, but it is not a replacement for telic activities that produce tangible outcomes
-   Living in the present means balancing the importance of both atelic and telic activities and finding value in both the journey and the destination.

1.  The idea of people being classified as failures has a history dating back to the mid-1800s, when the term "failure" for people was first recorded in the dictionary.
2.  In the 19th century, Americans' self-worth was largely measured by prosperity and financial success, leading to feelings of shame and spiritual collapse for those who failed.
3.  The concept of being a "failure" has been exacerbated by an individualist ethos in which success or failure is attributed to the person rather than social circumstances.
4.  The belief that hard work alone leads to success can lead to a refusal to recognize systemic obstacles and a lack of social solidarity, contributing to feelings of hopelessness and despair.
5.  Black Americans are more aware of historical and contemporary structures of injustice that can impede prosperity, leading to a greater sense of collective struggle rather than personal failure.
6.  The trend towards viewing personal identity through a single enterprise, in which success or failure is measured by a specific outcome, has contributed to an increased focus on success and a fear of failure in modern society.
7.  The idea that a person's worth is tied to their success in a specific enterprise can be harmful, leading to a fear of taking risks and trying new things. It is important to recognize that success and failure are not absolute and to find value in the journey and process of pursuing goals.
