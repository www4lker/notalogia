If the Enneagram type Four, the Individualist, were to be associated with a pop culture character, one possibility could be Holden Caulfield from J.D. Salinger's novel "The Catcher in the Rye."

Holden Caulfield is a complex and sensitive character who is deeply in touch with his emotions and has a strong sense of individuality. He is highly introspective and self-aware, often questioning the authenticity and values of the people and the world around him. He holds a great desire to understand himself and others, and he struggles with feelings of alienation and longing.

These characteristics align with those of the Individualist, who also places a high value on authenticity, introspection, and individuality. Holden's struggles with understanding himself and his place in the world, as well as his feelings of alienation, are also consistent with the feelings of longing and unfulfilled longing that the Individualist can experience.

Like the animal analogy, this is one of the many possible association and other character could be associated with the individualist depending on how the traits are emphasized. Characters such as Holden's peers, Holden's sibling Allie or Henry David Thoreau could also be fitting association.
