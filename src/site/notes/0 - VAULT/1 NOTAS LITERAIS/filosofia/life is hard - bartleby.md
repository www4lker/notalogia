>The passage is discussing the idea that some desires and preferences are more valid than others and that one should not strive for a life that is "lacking in nothing." The example of Bartleby from Herman Melville's "Bartleby, the Scrivener" is used to illustrate how some desires can be detrimental and not make sense. The passage also suggests that there are limits to what is worth wanting and that within those limits, one can flourish in many ways by doing different things. The idea that a good life is "lacking in nothing" is seen as absurd and it is not necessary to partake in everything good.
