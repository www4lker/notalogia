>  Resumo: No artigo "Why Confucianism Matters for the Ethics of Technology" (Por que o confucionismo é importante para a ética da tecnologia), Pak-Hang Wong argumenta que o confucionismo é relevante para as considerações éticas na tecnologia, apesar de sua subordinação histórica da ciência e da tecnologia à perfeição ética. Wong enfatiza a importância dos conceitos confucionistas, como "Li" (ritual), para informar as reflexões éticas sobre tecnologia. O artigo discute a crítica de Joel Kupperman às principais teorias éticas e explora como o Li confucionista pode orientar estilos de interação e contribuir para conexões éticas com os outros. Wong destaca a natureza relacional da ética e o processo contínuo de reflexão ética na ética confucionista. O ideal confuciano de naturalidade sugere considerar não apenas o que fazemos e dizemos, mas também como fazemos e dizemos. O artigo conclui que o confucionismo é importante para a ética da tecnologia ao enfatizar a comunidade, o desempenho e a estética, e ao aplicar o Li confucionista às análises éticas da tecnologia. Ao incorporar os valores confucianos, o autor pretende promover um desenvolvimento mais humano da ciência e da tecnologia.

In the article "Why Confucianism Matters for the Ethics of Technology," Pak-Hang Wong argues that Confucianism is relevant to the ethics of technology, despite its historical subordination of science and technology to ethical perfection. The author highlights the importance of "Li" (ritual) in Confucian ethics and its relevance to the ethical reflection of technology.

Joel Kupperman's critique of mainstream analytic ethical theories as being irrelevant and incomplete is discussed, focusing on the ethical importance of styles of interaction and the role of Confucian Li in informing and guiding these styles. Current ethics of technology, such as postphenomenology, are considered in light of Kupperman's critique. Wong emphasizes the relational dimension of ethics and the ongoing nature of ethical reflection in Confucian ethics.

The Confucian ideal of naturalness compels us to consider the ethical import of not only what we should do and say, but also how we should do and say them. Confucian ethics recommend a close look at people's style of interaction, as it communicates people's attitudes and shows themselves to others, which are essential in ethically fruitful connections with others. The author concludes that Confucianism matters in the ethics of technology by focusing on community, performance, and aesthetics, and by demonstrating how Confucian Li can be applied to a Confucian ethics of technology. 

Wong suggests that the relational and developmental aspects of Confucian personhood can be applied to the ethical reflection of technology, emphasizing the significance of personal roles, relationships, and the ongoing nature of ethical cultivation. The article also highlights the importance of considering the ethical import of styles of interaction, as they convey people's attitudes and can affect the ethical outcome of a given situation.

By incorporating Confucian Li into the ethics of technology, Wong proposes an approach that emphasizes community, performance, and aesthetics. This approach examines the communicative, formative, and aesthetic functions of Li and their relevance to the ethical analysis of technology. By doing so, the author hopes to answer the question of why Confucianism matters in the ethics of technology and provide a more humane development of science and technology.
