The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and the Enneagram are both systems for understanding personality and how people see the world. However, they are based on different theoretical frameworks and have different approaches to classifying personality types.

The MBTI is based on Carl Jung's theory of psychological types and focuses on four dichotomies: extraversion vs. introversion, sensing vs. intuition, thinking vs. feeling, and judging vs. perceiving. These four dichotomies are used to create 16 different personality types, each with its own set of characteristics and traits.

The Enneagram, on the other hand, focuses on nine different personality types, each with its own set of characteristics and traits. It is not based on a specific theory or framework, and it is not based on four dichotomies like the MBTI.

Both the MBTI and the Enneagram are widely used in coaching and therapy contexts and can be used to help individuals understand their personality and behavior patterns, but they are not directly related and use different methodologies. Some proponents of each theory may suggest that it is complimentary to the other or that one is more accurate than the other. However, both theories have benefits and limitations and the choice of which one to use depends on the specific context and objectives.
