>When engaging in a debate, maintain a composed and respectful demeanor. Recognize that the person you are arguing with has the same right to be heard as you do. Practice active listening and provide the same level of attention you would like to receive. Avoid becoming disruptive, and remember that both parties are entitled to their rights. Consider that the other person may have a valid point of view, and approach the discussion calmly. By doing so, you can establish a reputation as a rational and educated individual.
