>Avoid treating prayer as a means of making repeated requests. Remember that the divine already knows what we need, even before we ask for it. When you do ask for something, ask for it on behalf of others as well, especially those in similar circumstances. Avoid selfishness during prayer, and instead use it as an opportunity to express your love for others. By asking for everyone's well-being, you will ultimately benefit yourself as well. Like lighting a lamp, the person who illuminates the way for others is the first to receive the light.
