>Compassion and empathy are essential qualities for building strong relationships and contributing to a more positive and harmonious world. By being attentive and understanding towards others, we can provide a supportive and caring presence for those in need. This requires cultivating a sense of inner peace and equanimity, as well as being mindful of our own emotional states and the impact they can have on those around us. By prioritizing our own mental and emotional health, we can better serve those around us and create meaningful change in the world.
