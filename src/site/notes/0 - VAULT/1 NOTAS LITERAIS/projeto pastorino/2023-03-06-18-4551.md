>A parent's example is a powerful teacher for their children. Avoid arguing with your spouse in front of your children, as it may harm their emotional well-being. Avoid criticizing or speaking ill of your partner, as it may affect your child's perception of them. Instead, try to set a positive example by showing respect and love towards your partner. A harmonious and well-functioning home is a precious gift that you can give to your children. Remember that your children are the result of your own choices and actions, so strive to be a positive influence on their lives.
