>It's important to protect our emotional and mental well-being by avoiding unhealthy environments and ill-intentioned people. However, if we can maintain our own virtue and positivity, it may be possible to make a positive impact on these negative situations. We should be mindful of our own boundaries and limitations, and not allow ourselves to be drawn into harmful or toxic situations. Like the sun shining on a swamp, we can bring light and warmth to even the darkest places, but we must be careful not to let ourselves be contaminated by the negativity around us. By staying true to our own values and living as an example of our beliefs, we can be a positive force for change and bring greater harmony and understanding to our world.
