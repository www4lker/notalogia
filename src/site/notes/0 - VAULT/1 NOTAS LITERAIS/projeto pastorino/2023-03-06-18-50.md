>Visit those in need. Dedicate time to comforting those who are struggling, whether they are poor, sick, or simply going through a hard time. Offering comfort and support, even if it requires sacrifice on your part, is a duty of compassion and humanity. Don't wait for them to seek you out before acting with kindness and empathy. And don't underestimate the benefits you'll receive: the act of consoling someone in distress can bring great rewards to both giver and receiver.
