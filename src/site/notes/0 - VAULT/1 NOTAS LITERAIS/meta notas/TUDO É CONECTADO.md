# The FUN and EFFICIENT note-taking system I use in my PhD
## O CANAL QUE ME APRESENTOU ZETTEL E OBSIDIAN
The Zettelkasten method of note-taking and knowledge management changed my life and saved my PhD! Originally used by Niklas Luhmann, a German sociologist who wrote hundreds of articles and over 70 books in his lifetime, "zettelkasten" means "slip box" because Luhmann's system was in a literal slip box filled with note cards. I host mine, though, in a program called Obsidian (link below). If my overview of this method got you intrigued, here are some other resources to check out that go into more detail: The best book length overview of the zettelkasten system is "How to Take Smart Notes" by Sonke Ahrens. I find it useful for getting inspiration and there's an audiobook, too, if you just need a refresher/some motivation: [https://takesmartnotes.com/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbjJvTDY3TDJUWlBBN01yUHpWYUVFaW0tdmljUXxBQ3Jtc0trbUJEQmh2NDNhTGpCT1VLSDUzYnpvazRpQXNYb3JXMWhfTUtWU3U1X05lNy1kX3Q4aDRoN2dSZVNqd0phWjNKNm9NbnhheEdZaEd6TXpQZHl3bk5MLTc3LU5VV2xnYXNZTmI2LXlNM0xfVFFBWGFYSQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Ftakesmartnotes.com%2F&v=L9SLlxaEEXY) By far the resource I return to the most is a post by Sascha on the Zettelkasten website called "Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method." I also just surf that website whenever I run into an issue with my own zettelkasten, because 100% someone has answered my question there: [https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbXlYVHlEUnYwczhEQVcwaXJhWlRDdWJjWmdWd3xBQ3Jtc0trUmQyaHNPc004T0NrQnMxS2hwN1JCTmJBR1lFemhGTUlVLW0xcFE1YUp1TC1KTzBVTDVQZzRncVRWQjBfekhDU0VkNnFDUFh0OE1UUXhRamhMQXZZNXJ3SHJGVnZTTC1RSTRTRjAtUmRRTUcxdlJ4NA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fzettelkasten.de%2Fintroduction%2F&v=L9SLlxaEEXY) Obsidian has a VERY useful "help" section once you download it.
