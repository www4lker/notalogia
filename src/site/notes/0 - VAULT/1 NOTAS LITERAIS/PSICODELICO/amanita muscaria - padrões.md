1.  Amanita muscaria is commonly found in the fall, particularly in the Rheinland-Pfalz area of Germany.
2.  Drying the mushrooms and mixing them to create a more homogenous batch is a common preparation method.
3.  The onset of effects is typically quick, within 30 minutes to an hour of ingestion.
4.  Dizziness, drowsiness, stomach discomfort and slight visual changes are common initial effects.
5.  Sweating, salivating, and urination are commonly reported effects.
6.  Muscimol, the psychoactive compound found in Amanita muscaria, is often lost in urine and not consumed.
7.  Euphoria, heightened sense of music and sound, and a "mindful zombie" state are reported effects.
8.  Nausea, hallucinations, and fear are also reported effects.
9.  The peak experience is usually short, lasting 1-2 hours.
10.  Dream enhancement is a common side effect when taken in the evening.

This aligns with current understanding of Amanita Muscaria effects, which include dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, hallucinations, and euphoria, as well as a heightened sense of music and sound, and a "mindful zombie" state. Sweating, salivating, and urination are also commonly reported effects. The nausea, hallucinations, and fear reported in some accounts are also consistent with known negative effects of Amanita Muscaria. The dream enhancement effect is also consistent with the traditional use of Amanita Muscaria in shamanic practices.
