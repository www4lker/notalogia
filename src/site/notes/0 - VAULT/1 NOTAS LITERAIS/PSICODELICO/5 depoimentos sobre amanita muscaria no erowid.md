## Primeiro depoimento

>The author, who has had experience with mind-altering substances, is interested in ancient cultures and religions and came across the plant/drug called Soma in the Rig Veda. They decided to try Amanita Muscaria, which is a popular candidate for Soma, and purchased two 28 gram bags of dried Amanita Muscaria from an internet site. They started with small doses, added to chamomile tea, and gradually increased the dosage over time. They experienced mild effects, such as slight euphoria, sweating, salivating, and urinating. The author eventually took a large dose and experienced intense sweating, salivating, and blurred vision but no pleasant hallucinations. They became nauseous and felt like they had been poisoned, but tried to understand the mental images and realized there were things in their life that needed to be fixed.

## Segundo depoimento

>The author is trying Amanita muscaria for the first time, a mushroom that contains muscimol and ibotenic acid. They consumed 6.5 grams of prepared (baked caps and dried skins) Amanita muscaria and experienced effects such as nausea, dizziness, and increased salivating. The author also noted that baking the mushroom before consuming it increases the muscimol levels and makes the Amanita muscaria stronger. The author found the mushroom to have a nice taste, similar to baked french fries. The effects of the mushroom were difficult for the author to communicate and type due to their visuals and cognitive confusion.

## Terceiro depoimento
>The author had three experiences with Amanita muscaria (Fly Agaric), with the first two being less successful using 1 gm and 1.5 gm of X10 extract. They obtained 2 X 25 gm packs of dried extract and decided to take the mushroom on a Sunday in December 2005. They ground the dried mushroom material and mixed it with canned mushroom soup, which they consumed at 1200 hours GMT. They began to feel drowsy and nausious 45 minutes after taking the mushrooms, and went to lie in bed to listen to music. They experienced a loop-like thought cycle, sweating, and an intense spiritual state, feeling like they were moving from lifetime to lifetime. As the trip peaked at 1830 hours GMT, the author went downstairs and called a friend to tell them about the experience. By 2230 hours GMT, the trip had downgraded and the author felt relaxed and refreshed. The next few days, the author felt chilled out at work and had a lower libido, but it came back five days later. The experience was life-changing and awe-inspiring.

## Quarto depoimento

>The author recounts their experiences with Amanita muscaria, a type of mushroom. They have had past experiences with the mushroom, including one where they and a roommate each took three caps and felt high and had vivid dreams, and another where they and two friends each took five caps and felt antsy and ran around a playground. In their most recent experience, they and three friends each took about 5.5 caps of the mushroom and had a more intense and terrifying experience. The author describes feeling disoriented and losing their coordination, and experiencing flickers in their consciousness. They express regret for not taking the mushroom more seriously and not following the standard rules for taking hallucinogens.

## Quinto depoimento

>The author describes their experience consuming Amanita muscaria, a type of psychedelic mushroom, in the Rheinland-Pfalz area of Germany. They had picked the mushrooms in the autumn and were testing different batches to determine proper dosing. They made a tea with 7.5g of the mushrooms and also ate some of the dregs. The onset of effects was quick, with dizziness, drowsiness, stomach discomfort, and slight visual changes occurring within 15 minutes. The author also experienced a typical low-to-mid-dose Amanita high, including being alert and physically active, enjoying music, and having a detached mental state. The peak experience lasted for about 1-1.5 hours and the author was able to fall asleep easily afterwards.

1.  Amanita muscaria is commonly found in the fall, particularly in the Rheinland-Pfalz area of Germany.
2.  Drying the mushrooms and mixing them to create a more homogenous batch is a common preparation method.
3.  The onset of effects is typically quick, within 30 minutes to an hour of ingestion.
4.  Dizziness, drowsiness, stomach discomfort and slight visual changes are common initial effects.
5.  Sweating, salivating, and urination are commonly reported effects.
6.  Muscimol, the psychoactive compound found in Amanita muscaria, is often lost in urine and not consumed.
7.  Euphoria, heightened sense of music and sound, and a "mindful zombie" state are reported effects.
8.  Nausea, hallucinations, and fear are also reported effects.
9.  The peak experience is usually short, lasting 1-2 hours.
10.  Dream enhancement is a common side effect when taken in the evening.

This aligns with current understanding of Amanita Muscaria effects, which include dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, hallucinations, and euphoria, as well as a heightened sense of music and sound, and a "mindful zombie" state. Sweating, salivating, and urination are also commonly reported effects. The nausea, hallucinations, and fear reported in some accounts are also consistent with known negative effects of Amanita Muscaria. The dream enhancement effect is also consistent with the traditional use of Amanita Muscaria in shamanic practices.

Hallucinating in the Mind

## Amanita muscaria by [Petri](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.cgi?A=Search&AuthorSearch=Petri&Exact=1)

Citation:   Petri. "Hallucinating in the Mind: An Experience with Amanita muscaria (exp368)". Erowid.org. Jun 11, 2000. erowid.org/exp/368

DOSE:  15 g - oral
[Amanitas - A. muscaria](https://www.erowid.org/plants/amanitas/)
  
Over in Finland A. muscaria grows all over the place - it's very common and it's maybe the most common mushroom that you can find in city area (it's grow in parks, woods, cemeteries, etc.). At first time we (one friends of mine and I) took about five grams of dried cap and smoked some pot (to prevent nausea and to potentiate the trip. We didn't get much out of it so we tried two week later 15g each and only the best part of the mushroom - yellow flesh just under the skin (we ate skin too but I think it doesn't change the experient in anyway because there is so little of it). Both times we made soup out of the mushrooms. All you people should also remember they say that American and European mushrooms contains different amount of different alkaloids in them ... but they also say that it's FDA/DEA's rumour to make people to think that American ones are toxic.  
  
Anyway - the trip was weird. It was kind of sleepy, but not like I have heard people telling that it's makes you to go very sleep like state with losing your memory. Mushrooms made me feel nausea, but this was prevented with pot. Nausea from A. muscaria was pretty bad so we waited as long as we could and then smoked pot and after one toke it was gone! Pot works somehow for all the nauseas but it's totally awesome for A.muscaria. We smoked some more pot though because we figured out that it blows us much higher than only the shrooms. Trip was hallucinating but there was no color patterns and other visuals. It was more like hallucinating in the mind and other ones were very real like we saw fog all over the place (we were hanging around the town) and we saw that water on the pavement was frozen, but later we heard that there was neather fog nor temperature below 50F. When I'm talking about 'we' I really mean it - WE BOTH SAW THOSE THINGS and I can't think why it was like that. One example of those in-mind hallucinations that I saw ... no I imagined that there was open field with red colored devils coming out of the ground and smiling to me. It was very wierd all those devil looked totally the same and there looked like devil should :) - They had horns, there skin was likes fish's skin and they had that 'devils fork' on their hand. That was kind of funny/scarey, but it didn't last more than few seconds.  
  
The trip was also very confusing. We lost sense of the place and we got lost in my hometown that we knew very well. Next morning we remembered where we had been, but on the trip we didn't. My friend also got lost on the parking lot were I left him while I was going to buy some fast food (he was scared to go with me to the fast food place because there were too many people). When I came back he was like 'oh thanks! I didn't know how to get out of the parking lot'. The Trip was also very euphoric, aphrodisiactic and funny. We were laughing very spontaneously and at one moment we just started to laugh with no reason and then we ran away because we were in public place and there was people. At one moment I even felt that I couldn't prevent to cum in my pants - it felt that good! (I didn't come in my pants though ... really :) ). Anyway when I bought that fast food we went to eat near by the soccer field and my friend told that the field was glowing yellow and there was men playing soccer (one of those 'in-mind' hallucinations) and I was hearing the sounds of the game.  
  
I haven't take it for two years because I thought that it's toxic and bad for brain cells (so is ethanol, but I don't do that either). It would be really nice if someone had information about it's long time toxity. Now when I refreshed my memory I remember that it was nice I'll maybe do it again at next fall! Next time I would like to take more though (maybe 20-25 g), but I'm kind scared because of it's possible toxity.
