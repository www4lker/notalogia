In the past twenty years, the term "geopolitics" has gone from being exotic and quaint to dominating political discourse. The surge in its usage has been seen in two periods: after the 2007-08 global financial crisis and after 2014-15 with the annexation of Crimea and the Syrian War. This shift in the use of the term reflects a change in the global landscape and is reflective of a resistance to US power projection.

Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping are seen as the catalysts of the modern turn to geopolitics. Putin declared the collapse of the Soviet Union to be the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, and his 2007 speech at the Munich Conference on Security Policy was a pivotal moment in which he denounced the concept of unipolarity and the US's tendency to impose its economic, political, cultural, and educational policies on other nations.

Putin and China both view global geopolitics in terms of losses and humiliation, and have responded to them by asserting their power and influence. China's response was inspired by the global financial crisis when it looked as if they were rescuing global capitalism, and its leader has urged four strengths: political influence, economic competitiveness, image, and appealing morality. This has led to a clearer view of a multipolarised world.

The Russian attack on Ukraine in 2022 has brought geopolitics home to everyone, particularly in the US and Europe. The US treasury secretary Janet Yellen has talked of reordering trade relations, building relations with allies and reducing dependence on strategic competitors, while the EU's president Ursula von der Leyen has promised a turn to a geopolitical Commission. The EU's de facto foreign minister, Josep Borrell, has spoken of the need to relearn the language of power and conceive of Europe as a top-tier geostrategic actor in a globalised world.

In short, the answer to the question is that it is difficult to say how much politicians and pundits who speak of geopolitics really know, as the term is both nebulous and ambiguous, and can be used to describe two very different worldviews.

**Karl Haushofer**, a German political scientist, was influential in the development of the study of geopolitics in the early 20th century. He was given the family farm, Hartschimmelhof, in Bavaria as a wedding present from his father-in-law. He saw himself as the prophet of geopolitics, but was unable to clearly explain what it actually was. Geopolitics is linked to the concepts of power, humiliation, and international relations. It is believed that Haushofer's farm is the origin of this demand for geopolitics.

Last summer, my family visited Hartschimmelhof, a farm shop that sells paper goods and was open a few hours a week as publicised online. Upon entering, an eerie mixture of music and birdsong started to play from a speaker in the corner. Outside the old farmhouse, a notice warned of a dangerous dog, but was in fact a black Galloway calf. The whole setup at Hartschimmelhof exuded mystery, which was appropriate for the concept of geopolitics. This was a theory developed by Johan Rudolf Kjellén in the book Introduction to Swedish Geography (1900) which states that European history is driven by the contest for three river basins: of the Rhine, the Danube, and the Vistula.

Karl Haushofer was influenced by the German geographer Friedrich **Ratzel** and the English geographer and director of the London School of Economics Halford Mackinder, both of whom had different theories on space and power. Ratzel's concept of ***Lebensraum*** or living space and Mackinder's distinction between maritime and land powers were influential in Germany and Russia. Haushofer was fascinated by Asian politics, and wrote his doctoral thesis Dai Nihon: Reflections on Greater Japan’s Military Strength, World Position, and Future (1913) which explored Japan's pursuit of clashes with its neighbours, China and Russia. He believed Germany should imitate Japan's approach to power and that a "storm of steel" was necessary for rejuvenation.

Karl Haushofer believed that due to the chaos in Central Europe, there was a need for widespread public re-education to help people understand geopolitics and to awaken their instinct for it. His student **Rudolf Hess** brought this view to Adolf Hitler's attention, who found it useful and made it a central part of the Nazi programme. Haushofer's most intense contact with Hitler was when Hitler was dictating Mein Kampf in prison. While Hitler did not mention geopolitics in his book, he did reference the importance of conflict and the need for German Lebensraum, which was likely influenced by Haushofer.

Although Karl Haushofer was influential in Nazi Germany, his wife Martha was categorized as Jewish under Nazi race laws, making him increasingly vulnerable to persecution. After his son Albrecht was arrested, he cultivated a relationship with the military opposition, and was eventually interned in Dachau. Albrecht was later killed by the SS in the last days of the war. Despite Haushofer's influence, his fate was ultimately linked to his wife's status as a Jew.

After the war, preparing for the Nuremberg war crimes trial, the US chief of counsel Sidney S Alderman, in a memorandum for the US associate justice Robert H Jackson, wrote that:

> Haushofer was Hitler’s intellectual godfather. It was Haushofer, rather than Hess, who wrote _Mein Kampf_ and who furnished the backbone for the Nazi bible and what we call the common criminal plan. Geopolitics was not merely academic theory. It was a driving, dynamic plan for the conquest of the heartland of Eurasia and for domination of the world by the conquest of that heartland.

However, in the end Jackson appears not to have been convinced, and a few weeks later released Haushofer from internment.

The Jesuit scholar of international relations, Edmund Walsh, played a significant role in Jackson's surprising decision. Walsh had a strong belief in the necessity of morality in foreign relations, but after the Second World War, he began to think that geopolitics was necessary in order to stop the Soviets from taking over Mackinder's heartland. This led to a new form of American geopolitics which was seen as a way to assert dominance. Walsh argued that ideals and hopes would be useless without the ability to back them up, which is why Jackson made his decision.

Karl and Martha Hartshimmel were a devoted couple who tragically took their own lives in 1946. Karl was previously released from American internment. The couple left a note and two empty coffins for their son Heinz, along with a map of the Hartschimmelhof where their bodies were to be found. Karl Haushofer, a German geopolitician, had a substantial following in both the Western superpower and Soviet Union. Karl Radek, secretary of the Comintern and a critic of Stalin, maintained contacts with German diplomats in the 1930s and was involved in an initiative to translate Haushofer into Russian. There was a wider interest in geopolitics, demonstrated by a Russian journal in the 1920s and the Great Soviet Encyclopaedia in 1929. This was intensified by the experience of German defeat and revolution in 1918-19.

In the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, there was a resurgence of geopolitics in Russia. This was led by **Alexander Dugin**, who described geopolitics as "the essence of Russian culture." The perception that the disintegration of the old empire was a political humiliation imposed by the outside world acted as a powerful motivating factor. This was similar to the situation in 1920s Germany, where geopolitics flourished following the collapse of the powerful German empire. Putin stated that the epidemic of collapse had spread to Russia, leading to a spiral of decay.

>In the 1980s-90s I encountered the status of geopolitics as a discipline in the international expert community. I discovered geopolitics by way of Karl Haushofer and the works of the Conservative Revolution and I thought that geopolitics is a kind of politically incorrect doctrine which is greatly explanatory and of great use to us, to Russia. In my eyes, I thought that geopolitics has the status of something past, something prohibited, something politically incorrect – and I liked that.

Alexander Dugin has been compared to his mentor Karl Haushofer due to their shared political views. Both men wanted to create a large land bloc stretching from Germany through Russia to Japan, with Haushofer being upset at Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. Dugin talks about creating a Eurasian empire and a new-fascist international that encompasses Europe, while Putin is more interested in recreating a Russian empire and sphere of influence. Additionally, both men had a family tragedy; Haushofer's son was killed by the Nazi regime and Dugin's daughter was likely assassinated by the Russian security services.

The connection between Putin and Alexander Dugin, the Russian’s leading geopolitician, is not one to be underestimated. Despite Putin's attempts to downplay their relationship, Dugin's presence in the background allows Putin to appear moderate, calculated and diplomatic in his approach to foreign relations.

This essay examines the current fascination with geopolitics and its intellectual dynamics. It highlights the use of geopolitics by Russia's President Putin to make himself appear reasonable and statesmanlike in his approach to international relations. It also draws comparisons to post-1919 Germany, where geopolitics gave people an appealing way of explaining a newly chaotic world. The essay ultimately warns that this way of thinking can be dangerous and may poison everyone else’s politics too.
