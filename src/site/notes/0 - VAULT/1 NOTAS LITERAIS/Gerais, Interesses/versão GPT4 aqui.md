>Autofiction books, such as those in Knausgard's My Struggle series, are usually written by authors who use autobiographical elements in their narrative. Through characters that resemble real people and events that approximate their own lives, autofiction authors explore themes such as identity, memory, and subjectivity. These books can challenge literary conventions, creating a sense of intimacy and authenticity for the reader. However, they can also generate criticism and controversy, especially when the boundaries between the real and the imagined become difficult to distinguish. Ultimately, reading autofiction books is a unique and personal experience, and can offer profound insights into life and literature. That being said, end what about Knausgard's writing to what extent can we attest to its quality while separating the literary phenomenon from the thing itself? Is he really a good writer? How far can we delve into the genealogy of his literary tradition? Whoever likes this kind of author will like what else?

Karl Ove Knausgård's writing has garnered both praise and criticism, making it difficult to definitively attest to its quality. However, there are certain aspects of his work that can be examined to gain insight into his writing style and the reasons behind the strong reactions his work often elicits.

Knausgård's writing is characterized by its extreme attention to detail, unflinching honesty, and introspection. He often delves into mundane aspects of daily life, making the ordinary feel extraordinary. His writing has been praised for its immersive quality, which allows readers to feel deeply connected to the narrative. It is this depth of connection that has contributed to Knausgård's literary success and the popularity of the My Struggle series.

However, critics argue that his exhaustive focus on minutiae can make the narrative tedious and self-indulgent. Additionally, his willingness to expose the lives of those around him, often without their consent, raises ethical concerns and has led to backlash from family members and friends portrayed in his work.

Knausgård's literary tradition can be traced back to writers who have explored the boundaries between fiction and autobiography, such as Marcel Proust, whose monumental work "In Search of Lost Time" is often cited as an influence on Knausgård. Other authors who have dabbled in autofiction include J.M. Coetzee, Elena Ferrante, and Rachel Cusk.

Readers who enjoy Knausgård's work may also appreciate the following authors:

1.  Marcel Proust – As mentioned earlier, Proust's "In Search of Lost Time" is a seminal work that explores memory and subjectivity in a similar vein to Knausgård's writing.
2.  Elena Ferrante – The Italian author's Neapolitan Novels combine elements of autobiography and fiction in a story about the lifelong friendship between two women.
3.  Rachel Cusk – Cusk's "Outline" trilogy is an innovative blend of autofiction and literary fiction that explores themes of identity, relationships, and the nature of storytelling.
4.  Annie Ernaux – This French author's works often draw from her own life experiences and provide a profound exploration of memory and identity.
5.  Sheila Heti – Heti's "How Should a Person Be?" is a semi-autobiographical novel that examines the complexities of friendship, art, and self-discovery.

In conclusion, determining the quality of Knausgård's writing is subjective, as different readers will have varying reactions to his work. However, there is no denying that he has made a significant impact on contemporary literature and has contributed to the growing popularity of autofiction as a genre.
