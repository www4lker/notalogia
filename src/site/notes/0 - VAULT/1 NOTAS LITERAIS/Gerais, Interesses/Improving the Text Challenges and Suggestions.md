Point out what I can improve in the following text: 

>But of all the challenges, the biggest is climate change, an inescapable fact that many scientists only disagree on the size of its impact. Agro, for its size and for the responsibility it evokes, needs to unite in a broad front for the future of the world. Not alone, of course, since this is a major social and cultural change. But the people are with agro, and Brazil is especially apt to face whatever is to come. The country alone possesses ten percent of the planet's biodiversity and can help minimize the effects of global warming to a large extent. Agribusiness has a crucial role to play in this, and it is precisely in the people of the countryside, with their ancestral wisdom - combined with state-of-the-art technology, that the hope for a better future lies.

One potential improvement for the text would be to provide *more specific examples of how the agribusiness sector can work with other stakeholders to address the challenges of climate change*. Additionally, *the text could provide more detail about how Brazil's biodiversity and agricultural expertise can be used to minimize the effects of global warming*. *Additionally, it may be helpful to clarify the relationship between ancestral wisdom and state-of-the-art technology,* and how they can be combined to create a better future.
