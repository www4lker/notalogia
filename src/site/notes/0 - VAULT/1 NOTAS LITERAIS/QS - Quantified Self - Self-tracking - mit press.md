Based on the queries performed on the document, here are the thematically separated notes on Quantified Self:

**1. Definition and Misunderstandings of Quantified Self**
   - The term "Quantified Self" is widely used by journalists, industry pundits, and academics to refer to anything related to self-tracking. However, it's often used to refer to the exact opposite of what people in the Quantified Self community are trying to achieve. This usage often ignores the concerns and definitions of the community members themselves.

**2. Quantified Self as a Community**
   - The Quantified Self community is a significant group where people question doctors' orders and satisfy their curiosity. The focus is on discovery, not compliance with a prescribed way of doing things. Members have their own opinions on what "Quantified Self" really means, and there is something important happening under that name that should not be conflated with other imaginings about self-tracking.

**3. Quantified Self and Self-Tracking**
   - The book uses "self-tracking" when talking about the practices and the social phenomenon of people keeping track of themselves. "Quantified Self" is used to refer to the specific community founded by Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly.

**4. Quantified Self and Other Communities**
   - Online patient communities, professional interest communities, and personal communities all play a role in the understanding and interpretation of self-tracking data. These communities are where people turn to for help in making sense of their data.

Please note that these notes are based on the search results and may not cover all instances of the topics in the book. For a more comprehensive understanding, it would be beneficial to read the book in its entirety.
