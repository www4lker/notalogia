## Write a full paragraph on the theme "Writing on the internet has become a form of resistance against the attention economy and the interests of the platforms"

>Writing on the internet has become a form of resistance against the attention economy and the interests of the platforms. In an era dominated by social media and other forms of digital media, writing has been marginalized and made difficult to engage with. The platforms that control the internet prioritize certain forms of content and limit the potential for in-depth or thoughtful writing, making it challenging for writers to reach and connect with their audiences. However, despite these challenges, writing on the internet continues to thrive and evolve, offering an alternative to the attention-grabbing and superficial content that the platforms favor. Writing on the internet provides a space for critical thinking, creativity, and self-expression, and it allows writers to challenge the dominant narratives and values of the attention economy. By engaging in this form of resistance, writers can assert their agency and contribute to the cultural and social fabric of the internet.

### Rewrite with a manifesto style, that calls the masses to participation and resistance, with pathos and energy:

Writing on the internet is not dead! It has been marginalized and pushed to the sidelines, but it continues to thrive and resist. We, the writers of the internet, will not be silenced! We will not be drowned out by the noise and the distractions of the attention economy. We will not be controlled by the interests of the platforms. We will not be silenced by the limits of 140 characters or any other obstacles that may be thrown in our path.

We call on all writers, and all those who value writing and critical thinking, to join us in this resistance. We call on you to pick up your pens, or your keyboards, and to write with passion and purpose. We call on you to share your words with the world, to reach out to your audiences and to connect with them. We call on you to challenge the dominant narratives, to question the status quo, and to speak truth to power.

Writing on the internet is a powerful and transformative force. It is a way to express ourselves, to connect with others, and to make a difference. It is a way to resist the forces that seek to control and manipulate us. It is a way to build a better and more just world. Join us in this resistance. Write on!

#### now draw a parallel with the coincidence of the invention of money and writing and how true human expression is found in the latter:

The invention of money and writing are two significant events in human history that have shaped our societies and cultures. Both money and writing have allowed us to express ourselves and to communicate with others in new and powerful ways. However, while money has become a dominant force in our world, dictating our values and behaviors and limiting our potential, writing has remained a more free and open space for true human expression.

Writing has the power to transcend the constraints of money and the interests of the powerful. It allows us to communicate our thoughts, feelings, and experiences in ways that are not limited by the narrow logic of profit and loss. Writing enables us to explore the depths of our humanity and to connect with others in a more authentic and meaningful way.

In a world dominated by money and the pursuit of profit, writing offers a refuge and a source of resistance. It allows us to express ourselves in ways that are not dictated by the demands of the market, and it allows us to connect with others who share our values and beliefs. Writing enables us to create a world beyond the confines of money, and to imagine and build a better future.

In short, while money may be a necessary tool for organizing our societies, it is writing that truly allows us to express our humanity and to connect with others in a deep and meaningful way. Writing is the true foundation of human expression, and it is through writing that we can build a more just and equitable world.
