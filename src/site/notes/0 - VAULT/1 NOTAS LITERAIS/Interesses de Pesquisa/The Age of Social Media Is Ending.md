-   Facebook is in decline, with its ad business in trouble and its value having lost hundreds of billions of dollars
-   Twitter is in chaos due to Elon Musk's takeover, leading to advertisers pulling spending and users leaving the platform
-   The age of social media may be coming to an end
-   The shift towards social media happened around the end of the aughts and turned connections into a latent broadcast channel
-   Social media systems are designed to deliver an endless stream of content and have caused problems including people seeing themselves as celebrities and pundits
-   The potential downfall of Facebook and Twitter presents an opportunity to move away from these platforms.
-   Many social networks have existed over the years, including Six Degrees, Friendster, MySpace, LinkedIn, Hi5, Facebook, Orkut, Google Buzz, Google+, Bebo, Flickr, YouTube, and blogs
-   Some of these social networks have become widely popular while others have not
-   Content-sharing sites have also acted as social networks, allowing people to see material posted by those they know or know of
-   Many blogs and social networks have had limited reach and engagement.
- The term "social media" did not exist two decades ago and originally referred to social networking sites or services
-   These sites and services were originally intended for connecting and building relationships with trusted contacts and connections
-   Around 2009, the focus of these sites and services shifted from connection to publishing and broadcasting content as widely as possible
-   The shift towards social media has had both disastrous and pleasurable consequences and has been massively profitable.

---
-   The terms "social network" and "social media" should not be used interchangeably
-   A social network is a passive system for storing contacts and connections, while social media is an active system for broadcasting content across those networks
-   The shift from social networks to social media began around 2003-2005 and involved reinterpreting the network as a channel for broadcasting
-   Social media was initially seen as a magical innovation that made it easy to connect with people from the past and facilitated business connections
-   However, the toxicity of social media has caused it to lose its magic.
-   Twitter was probably the first true social media site, allowing users to talk to everyone and instantly learn about a wide range of topics
-   Twitter is a constant stream of sources, events, and reactions and has become important for journalists
-   Social media was already present in spirit before it was named as such, with RSS readers, MySpace, YouTube, and Flickr allowing users to create and consume content for any reason or no reason
-   Social media overtook social networking as the focus of these sites and services.
-   Instagram was a bridge between the social network era and the age of social media, relying on connections among users to distribute content
-   Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter all added features to encourage users to share content published by others to increase engagement
-   Reddit, Snapchat, WhatsApp, and TikTok are all more popular than Twitter and prioritize the flow of content over connections
-   In the social media era, connections are only necessary to allow content to flow, rather than being essential for both content creation and consumption.

1.  Social networks, which were previously focused on connecting people, evolved into social media platforms that prioritize the creation and distribution of content.
2.  This shift brought about the rise of the influencer economy, in which users became valuable as channels for distributing marketing messages or product sponsorships.
3.  However, social media's focus on emotionally charged content led to the spread of polarizing, offensive, or fraudulent information, creating a disaster for the platforms and society as a whole.
4.  The drive for massive scale and the resulting values of easily and cheaply reaching a large audience led to an unhealthy obsession with audience and an entitlement to an audience for every connection.
5.  This shift towards constant communication and the belief that every connection deserves an audience has resulted in an unhinged and sociopathic version of human sociality.

1.  Social networks, such as Six Degrees, Friendster, and LinkedIn, were originally focused on connecting people and building relationships.
2.  Social media, such as Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, emerged as platforms for publishing and sharing content with a wider audience.
3.  The shift from social networking to social media led to the rise of the influencer economy and data-driven advertising profits.
4.  However, it also contributed to the spread of polarizing, offensive, and fraudulent information and fueled obsessive behavior and entitlement.
5.  The future of social media is uncertain, but it may be possible to return to a more healthy and moderated version of social networking.

---
1.  The idea of "downscaling" social media, or using it in moderation, has become more plausible in the past year.
2.  Social media is fundamentally bad and cannot be made good, but it can be abandoned.
3.  To win back the soul of social life, people must learn to speak less on social media, to fewer people and less often.
4.  It is hoped that social media will eventually wither away.
