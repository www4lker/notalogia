## Stanford Computer Scientist Answers Coding Questions From Twitter

>Hi, Im a professor of Computer Science at Stanford University.
Today I'll be answering your questions from Twitter.

### "How many coding languages are there?"

>There are many different coding languages, including Python, Java Script, and C++. Some people even create their own coding languages for fun.

---

### "Can coding be self taught?" 
>Coding is a valuable skill that allows you to communicate with computers and create things out of nothing. There are many different coding languages, including Python, JavaScript, and C++. It is possible to learn to code without a formal education and become successful in the field. Many resources, including free classes from Stanford, are available to help individuals learn to code.

---

### "I always wondered in apocalyptic and action movies, how do coders manage to save the day without ever using Stack Overflow?"

>Stack Overflow is a website where coders can ask and answer questions and see code snippets to help them solve problems. Many serious coders use it to build better answers. The term "Stack Overflow" comes from a programming error where a program consumes too much memory. The website is a community for coders to help each other.

### "What does front end and back end mean?"
>The front end of an application is the part that runs on a device, like a phone, that a user interacts with. The back end runs on a server and does calculations. The internet is a network of devices connected to servers. Full stack engineers can program both the front end and the back end.


---
### "What is the shortest piece of code that changed the world?"

>Backpropagation is a few lines of code that tells an AI algorithm how to become smarter based on data. It is simple but based on calculus, and is the source of most AI's intelligence. It allows the AI to improve its understanding of things like cats.

---
### "How much could a C plus plus if a C plus could plus plus?"

>C++ is a popular programming language often used for intense programs like 3D games or Pixar movies. It is a descendant of the language C, which is considered the grandfather of all programming languages. C++ is known for its efficiency and ability to run complex programs quickly. It is related to other languages like Java and Python.

---
### "My computer science teacher asked, 'What is Python?' And I replied, 'A very dangerous snake.' And he beat me up."

>Python is a programming language named after the TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus. It is a general purpose language and can be used for a variety of tasks, including creating chatbots. The name Python comes from the show, and a simple program using the language might print "Hello world" and a range of numbers.

---
### "What is the meaning of error 404?"

>Error 404 is an error code that appears when a website cannot be found. It was created by Tim Berners-Lee, who also invented the web. Error codes help diagnose problems with web pages and were created as a sequence of numbers.

---

### "Are programming and coding the same thing?"


>Coding is the process of writing a sequence of commands in a specific language that a computer can understand, such as Python or JavaScript. This is how you tell a computer what to do when someone hits a button or opens an application. Programming is the same thing as coding.

---

### "What is Raspberry Pi and what can be used for?”


>A Raspberry Pi is a small, cheap computer that has a motherboard, USB ports, audio, internet connection, CPU, memory, and space for sensors. It is often used to create physical, interactive programs like robots or smart doorbells.

---
### "How do you code AI?" 

>AI stands for artificial intelligence, which is any algorithm that acts in an intelligent way. The most common type is machine learning, where an algorithm gets smarter by looking at data. The most common way to code AI is in Python using PyTorch or TensorFlow. In 2022, people may write AI by talking to large neural networks.
---
### "Do you practice algorithms frequently? If yes, why?"

>An algorithm is a piece of code that performs a task. Examples include an eye test algorithm or the TikTok algorithm, which chooses the next video to show. Algorithms can be complex and sometimes their inner workings are kept secret.


---
### "GitHub, what the hell is GitHub? It sounds rude."
>GitHub is a website where people can host and share their code with others. It is like Google Docs for code, and allows people to build on each other's ideas rather than starting from scratch.



---
### "Which coding language is the easiest one?"

>At Stanford, introductory computer science courses use the programming language Python. However, the first week uses an even simpler language called Carol, which is limited to movement and basic control flow. Carol is a good way to learn the basics of programming.

---
### "Do you have to be good at math to code? I  wanna learn but I'm terrible at math?”

>Contrary to popular belief, one does not need to be good at math to learn how to code. In fact, programming can improve logical thinking skills and math ability. To be a successful programmer, one should have a desire to build things and patience to work through challenges.

>The origin of coding and computer software can be traced back to World War II, when Alan Turing and other scientists in the UK built one of the first computers to decrypt German messages. Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage also played a significant role in the history of software, theorizing about the potential of computers in the 1800s and writing algorithms and programs without the use of computers.


---
### "Is coding required for web design?"

>Web design involves creating websites, often involving coding, and often also involving user experience design and artistic design. Hacking in computer science can involve writing impressive code or breaking into websites or databases, which is illegal. Knowing how to code can be useful for both legal and illegal hacking.

### "Why is coding important?"

>Coding is a process of using a programming language to communicate with computers and make them perform specific tasks. It is a useful and beautiful skill that can benefit many careers and is often used to create things out of nothing.
