The cultural industry produces false needs and manipulates people into consuming what they don't need through a variety of marketing and advertising techniques. These techniques are designed to create a sense of desire or need for cultural products that may not be necessary or beneficial to consumers.

One common technique used by the cultural industry to create false needs is the use of emotional appeals in advertising. For example, an advertisement for a cultural product may use images and music that are designed to evoke feelings of happiness, excitement, or nostalgia in the viewer. This can create a sense of desire or need for the product, even if the viewer may not actually need or benefit from it.

Another common technique used by the cultural industry to manipulate people into consuming what they don't need is the use of social pressure and peer influence. For example, an advertisement for a cultural product may use images of people enjoying the product in a social setting, or may use endorsements from popular or influential figures. This can create a sense that the product is popular or desirable, and can encourage people to consume the product in order to fit in or be accepted by their peers.

Overall, the cultural industry produces false needs and manipulates people into consuming what they don't need through the use of emotional appeals, social pressure, and peer influence in advertising and marketing. These techniques are designed to create a sense of desire or need for cultural products that may not be necessary or beneficial to consumers.
