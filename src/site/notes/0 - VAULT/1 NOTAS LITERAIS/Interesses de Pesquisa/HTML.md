## What is HTML?

HTML stands for “[HyperText](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) Markup Language.” It’s used to structure a webpage and its content — all webpages are made up of HTML.

The "HT" in HTML stands for HyperText, or links. Links are the oxygen of the web. By default rendered blue and underlined, links connect to you to other webpages, within the same site or elsewhere.
