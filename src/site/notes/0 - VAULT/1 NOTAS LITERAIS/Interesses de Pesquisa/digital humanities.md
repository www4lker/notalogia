>Digital Humanities is the application of computational methods and tools to the study of humanities subjects, such as literature, history, and art. This often involves the creation of digital versions of materials, such as texts or images, and the use of computational methods to analyze or interpret them. Digital Humanities encompasses a wide range of activities and often involves collaboration between scholars in different disciplines. It is a growing field that has the potential to fundamentally change the way that humanistic research is conducted and presented.

The components of **digital humanities work** can be expressed as MATERIALS + PROCESSING + PRESENTATION. In this formulation, digital humanities projects begin with **materials** (images, texts, maps, threedimensional models, sound and media files, or any combination of these) that are central to the research project. These materials are subject to **computational processing** (data mining or statistical analysis), which is followed by a **presentation** (web-based or offline) that organizes the results. A project can be digital without being online, but all online projects are based on digital files and computational processes. There are several fundamental activities that take the materials through processing and into presentation, including **mediation**/remediation, **datafication**/modelling, **processing**/analytics, **presentation**/display, and **sustainability**/preservation. Understanding these activities and how they engage technical and ethical considerations helps shape responsible work in digital projects.
