>The author expresses concerns about the ethical dimensions of new technologies, specifically in regards to the possibility of sentient robots. They reference a conversation with inventor Ray Kurzweil, who at the time was promoting a utopia in which humans gain near immortality by merging with robotic technology. The author expresses unease about this, and is particularly troubled by a passage detailing a dystopian scenario in which machines are permitted to make all their own decisions without human oversight, and society becomes so dependent on machines that the machines are in effective control.
