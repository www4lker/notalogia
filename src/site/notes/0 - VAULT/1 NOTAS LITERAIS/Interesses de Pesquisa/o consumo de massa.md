The mass consumption of culture in the contemporary era has a number of consequences. One of the most significant consequences is the homogenization of cultural products and practices. As people consume a large amount of cultural products, there is a tendency for these products to become more similar to each other in order to appeal to a wide audience. This can lead to a loss of diversity and a lack of support for less mainstream or independent cultural production.

Another consequence of mass consumption of culture is the increasing influence of the content industry. The content industry, which includes major media companies and publishing houses, has a significant amount of control over the production, distribution, and consumption of cultural goods and services. This concentration of power can lead to a lack of diversity and creativity in the cultural industry, as the content industry focuses on producing products that are likely to be successful in the marketplace.

Overall, the mass consumption of culture in the contemporary era has led to a number of consequences, including the homogenization of cultural products, the increasing influence of the content industry, and a potential loss of diversity and creativity in the cultural industry.
