# Is AI art really art?
[fonte](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1602490249917112320.html)

-  The question of whether AI-generated art is real art is a significant and interesting one.
-   Some people believe that AI art is not real art because it lacks the intention and personal vision of a human artist.
-   However, others argue that the fact that AI art looks like art and is used like art means that it is real art.
-   The question of whether AI art is real art ultimately depends on how we define art.
-   Many Renaissance artists were obsessed with composition and mathematical rules, and made preparatory sketches before completing a painting.
-   These sketches were an important part of the artistic process, as they allowed the artist to choose from an infinite number of possibilities and create a personal vision of the subject.
-   AI art lacks this personal vision and intention, but it can still be considered real art if it is used and appreciated like art.
