## Depoimento de um artista sueco sobre as ferramentas que criam arte:

Em resumo, o autor acredita que a arte AI é um problema porque é **derivada** e uma ameaça aos ilustradores freelance e artistas conceituais.

O autor também acredita que a AI art revela a verdadeira natureza de nossos novos senhores da tecnologia, que estão mais interessados em gerar arte derivada, sem sentido do que em criar algo novo e original.

Finalmente, o autor acredita que a AI art é apenas mais uma ferramenta que será usada para explorar e controlar os artistas em nossa distopia capitalista feudal.

>If you wonder why I'm not as active on here anymore, below is what my social media experience is mostly these days (and I do use the mute feature). Thanks and love to all of you who support me but I can't help it - I truly hate the world we now live in with every cell of my body.

>Also - "most likely to sue" ... A total of zero (0) times have I felt the urge to sue someone in my life, so the idea of people having this image of me being some art baron with my legal team on speed dial gives me insomnia.

>And while I'm here: I really hesitate to say anything about the legal implications of AI art but let me just say I have always felt (and stated so here in the past) that taking ideas from other artists is a cornerstone of a living, artistic culture. It's the impetus for new art.

>If we would sue every time one artist's idea shows up in another artist's work we would do nothing but sue each other all day. And I truly believe we produce lesser art if we constantly examine and censor our work based on legal anxieties.

>But ai-art is really a new type of problem. I personally don't feel overly threatened by what it produces, because it is so obviously derivative. But I no longer rely on freelance work. And back when I did, I hated it specifically beause most clients, long before ai was a thing,

>was already asking freelancers to do derivative work. So I definitely can see how ai-art is an immediate threat to freelance illustrators and concept artists. Most art jobs out there are not in places that give any real artistic and creative freedom to their artists.

>What I don't like about ai-tech is not that it can produce brand new 70s rock hits like "Keep On Glowing, You Mad Jewel" by Fink Ployd, but how it reveals that that kind of derivative, generated goo is what or new tech lords are hoping to feed us in their vision of the future.

>Anyway, I think ai-art, just like nfts, is a technology that just amplify all the shit I hate with being an artist in this feudal capitalist dystopia where every promising new tool always end up in the hands of the least imaginative and most exploitative and unscrupulous people.
