Here's a power-down routine for someone who enjoys reading before sleep and aims to achieve deep sleep by 11 pm and wake up at 7 am:

1. 9:30 pm - 9:50 pm: Preparing the Environment
   - Dim the lights in your bedroom to create a cozy atmosphere.
   - Set aside a comfortable reading spot with a soft light source.

2. 9:50 pm - 10:10 pm: Reading Session
   - Spend 20 minutes indulging in your favorite book or reading material.
   - Choose something relaxing and enjoyable to help calm your mind.

3. 10:10 pm - 10:30 pm: Hygiene Routine
   - Take care of your personal hygiene, such as brushing your teeth and washing your face.
   - Perform any other nightly self-care activities you prefer, like skincare or showering.

4. 10:30 pm - 10:50 pm: Relaxation Time
   - Engage in a calming activity to unwind and prepare for sleep.
   - Consider options like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or light stretching.
   - Alternatively, you can journal to express your thoughts and emotions.

5. 10:50 pm - 11:00 pm: Transition to Sleep
   - Put away any electronic devices or screens to minimize stimulation.
   - Set your alarm clock for the desired wake-up time to establish a consistent sleep schedule.
   - Ensure your bedroom is free from distractions, like turning off notifications on your phone or using earplugs if necessary.
   - Get into a comfortable sleeping position and allow yourself to drift off to sleep.

Remember, it may take some time to adjust to this new routine, so be patient and consistent with it. By following this power-down routine, you create a structured wind-down period that promotes relaxation, reduces distractions, and prepares your mind and body for deep sleep.
