# how to let other cite my work?

To create a Citation File Format (CFF) file from scratch, follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor: Use a plain text editor or a code editor of your choice to create the CFF file.

2. Start with the required fields: The CFF file has several required fields. Begin by adding the following fields:

   ```cff-version: 1.2.0
   message: [A concise message describing your software or project]
   ```

   Replace `[A concise message describing your software or project]` with a brief description of your project.

3. Add optional fields: You can include optional fields to provide more information about your project. Here are a few commonly used fields:

   - `title`: The title of your software or project.
   - `doi`: Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for your project.
   - `version`: The version number of your software or project.
   - `authors`: The list of authors involved in the project.
   - `url`: The URL where your project can be accessed.
   - `repository`: The URL of your project's repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
   - `license`: The license under which your project is distributed.
   - `date-released`: The release date of your software or project.

   Include any relevant optional fields based on the information you want to provide.

4. Add an example field: It's common to include an example or usage field to provide an example of how your project can be used. Here's an example:

   ```example: |
     ```bash
     $ your-command-here
     ```

     This command does XYZ.
   ```

   Replace `your-command-here` with an actual command and describe its purpose.

5. Save the file: Save the file with the extension ".cff" (e.g., `citation.cff`) to ensure it's recognized as a CFF file.

6. Validate the CFF file (optional): You can validate the CFF file to ensure it adheres to the CFF specifications. Use tools like `cffconvert` (https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert) or online validators like "CFF Validator" (https://citation-file-format.github.io/validate/) to validate your CFF file.

7. Include the CFF file: If you're using a package manager or a repository to distribute your project, include the `citation.cff` file in the project's root directory so that others can easily access and reference it.

By following these steps, you can create a basic CFF file from scratch. Remember to add relevant and accurate information about your project to make it informative and useful for others who may want to cite or reference your work.

## citing others

To reference other people's work in your Citation File Format (CFF), you can include a "references" field in your CFF file. Here's how you can reference other works:

1. Identify the work you want to reference: Determine the publication or work you want to reference, such as a research paper, software library, dataset, or any other scholarly work.

2. Gather the necessary information: Collect the relevant information about the work you are referencing. The specific details may vary depending on the type of work, but common information to include may consist of:

   - Authors: The names of the authors or creators of the work.
   - Title: The title of the publication or work.
   - DOI or URL: The Digital Object Identifier (DOI) or URL that uniquely identifies the work.
   - Date: The publication date or release date of the work.
   - Journal or Conference: If applicable, the name of the journal or conference where the work was published.
   - Volume, issue, or page numbers: If applicable, the volume, issue, or page numbers of the publication.

3. Format the reference in the "references" field: In your CFF file, add a "references" field and list each reference using the following format:

   ```references:
     - type: [type of reference, e.g., article, dataset, software]
       authors: [list of authors]
       title: [title of the work]
       doi: [DOI or URL of the work]
       date: [publication or release date]
       [additional fields specific to the type of reference]
   ```

   Replace the `[type of reference]`, `[list of authors]`, `[title of the work]`, `[DOI or URL of the work]`, `[publication or release date]`, and `[additional fields]` with the actual information for each reference.

   You can repeat this structure for each reference you want to include in your CFF file.

4. Save the file: Save the CFF file with the updated "references" field.

By including the "references" field in your CFF file and providing the necessary information for each reference, you enable others to see the works you have referenced and easily access them for further reading or citation purposes. Remember to ensure accuracy and completeness when providing the details of the referenced works.
