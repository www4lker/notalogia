# How can people sponsor my work?

To enable sponsorship on your GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your repository: Open the repository on GitHub that you want to enable sponsorship for.

2. Go to the "Settings" tab: On the repository page, locate the "Settings" tab, usually located at the top-right portion of the page. Click on it to access the repository settings.

3. Select "Sponsorships" in the left sidebar: In the settings sidebar, scroll down and click on "Sponsorships" under the "Features" section.

4. Enable sponsorship: On the Sponsorships page, you'll see an option to "Enable sponsorship." Click on the checkbox or toggle button to activate sponsorship for your repository.

5. Customize sponsorship tiers and benefits (optional): GitHub allows you to define multiple sponsorship tiers with different benefits for sponsors. If you want to customize the tiers and benefits, click on the "Customize" button. You can specify the sponsorship amounts, tier names, and associated perks or rewards for each tier. You can also add a custom description for your sponsorship program.

6. Save the changes: Once you've enabled sponsorship and made any desired customizations, click on the "Save changes" button to apply the settings.

7. Provide additional information (optional): GitHub may prompt you to provide additional information related to tax and payout details. This information is necessary if you wish to receive payouts from GitHub Sponsors. Follow the instructions provided to complete the required details.

8. Share your sponsorship link: After enabling sponsorship, GitHub will generate a unique URL for your repository's sponsorship page. You can find the link under the "Sponsorships" section of your repository settings. Share this link with your community, contributors, and supporters to promote and encourage sponsorship of your work.

By following these steps, you can enable sponsorship for your GitHub repository, allowing people to contribute financial support to your work. It's a way for your community to show appreciation and provide direct support to help you continue your development efforts.
