>That was very informative, thank you. Now, if possible, write a short fictional excerpt in the style of Knausgard where he, after his disillusionment with his writing career decides to change careers and become a backend programmer -- describe the scene where he walks into a senac room on a very hot day and finds a room of 20 year olds while he is already 42; be faithful to the author's style and try to philosophize a bit in the digressions typical of the author, where he thinks about the differences between the humanities education he had and the challenge of learning to program in order not to be unemployed and die of hunger

As I walked into the Senac room, the smell of artificial air conditioning hit me, a stark contrast to the oppressive heat that had been following me since I woke up. A room full of 20-year-olds, their faces buried in their laptops, greeted me with indifference, their eyes a mix of curiosity and disinterest. I was already 42, old enough to be a father to most of them, and I felt the weight of age pressing down on me, magnified by the sterile glare of the fluorescent lights above.

My life as a writer, a life filled with introspection, the quiet rustling of pages, and the endless search for the perfect word, seemed like a distant memory, a mirage in the desert of my new reality. I thought of my education in the humanities, years spent poring over dusty tomes and dissecting the nuances of language and the human experience. All of that had led me here, to this sterile room, where I would attempt to reforge myself in the fires of computer programming.

I couldn't help but draw parallels between the process of learning to program and my earlier journey as a writer. Both required an understanding of syntax and structure, a sense of logic that underpinned the beauty of their respective languages. But where writing allowed me to explore the depths of human emotion, programming seemed to be about finding the most efficient way to execute a task. I wondered if this new language I was about to learn could ever be as rich and fulfilling as the ones I had known before.

As I sat down in the back of the classroom, I couldn't help but feel a strange sense of loss, as if I were mourning the death of my former self. The transition from writer to backend programmer felt like a betrayal, a denial of the very essence of who I was. Yet, at the same time, I knew that I had to adapt, to embrace this new path, lest I find myself cast aside, unemployed, and dying of hunger in a world that no longer valued the humanities as it once did.

The instructor, a man in his early thirties, began the lesson, and I listened intently, trying to absorb the strange new vocabulary that seemed to slip through my fingers like sand. The young faces around me, so familiar with this digital landscape, seemed to grasp it with ease, while I struggled to find my footing.

In that moment, I realized that the world was changing, and I would have to change with it. As much as I longed for the quiet solitude of my writing desk and the comfort of my old life, I knew that I had to keep moving forward, to find a way to bridge the gap between the life I had known and the one that awaited me. And perhaps, in doing so, I could find a way to bring the richness of the humanities into the sterile world of programming, creating something new, something that merged the best of both worlds.
