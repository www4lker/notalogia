# Move slowly and fix things: recommended reading for designers 
## A reading list for designers who want to make a difference. ![Two people hold hands.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*CmkAiBUgfU7_rjot8VRGpA.jpeg)

One of tech’s sacred mantras is Mark Zuckerberg’s own, “move fast and break things.” Originally, this was meant to be guidance for developers and engineers to aim for disruption and shun the conventional–you can’t create the next big thing by taking cautious baby steps. But now [Meta has tried to distance itself from this motto](https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-mark-zuckerberg-new-values-move-fast-and-break-things-2022-2), because moving fast and breaking things results in, surprise surprise, broken things. For me, becoming a user experience professional seemed to be signing on to a sort of clean up crew: UX comes in after all the rush to develop and disrupt to tidy up toxic experiences. UX considers the big picture, and what’s more, the actual users. This means approaching tech from a mindful, inclusive, and empathetic place. Move slowly and fix things, as it were. If you’re interested in making technology that benefits the user rather than taking advantage of them, then this is the reading list for you. When I first started my UX journey, these books informed the development of a dedication to inclusive, empathetic design. 

Mismatch: How Inclusion Shapes Design by Kat Holmes # _1. Mismatch: How Inclusion Shapes Design_ by Kat Holmes [Kat Holmes](https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/women-in-ux-kat-holmes-8f1f93909730)’ guide to thinking inclusively is positively dense with wisdom. Drawing on her deep well of experience at Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce she abolishes the idea of “normal” or “average” and invites designers to be just as considerate of disability as they are of diversity. [In her words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBjhniwwH8A&t=1250s), “Disability is often mentioned last if at all in that list of human diversity, which I find incredibly strange because human ability is one of those kinds of human diversity that transcends every other kind of human diversity.” _Mismatch_ details how users could be temporarily, permanently, or situationally mismatched, or unable to interact with, an experience. Indeed, these mismatches are historically what inspired many of the most essential tools we use today, from keyboards to bendy straws. In this way, _Mismatch_ serves as both a history book and design guide. Each chapter ends with takeaways that stick–and indeed should be stuck–in the mind of anyone who has anything to do with design processes. These takeaways recognize our exclusion habits (like creating experiences using our own abilities as a baseline) and how we can move toward inclusion (identifying ability biases and mismatched interactions). This book should be **_required_** (extra emphasis here) for anyone even glancingly interested in design.

The article recommends a reading list for designers who want to create technology that benefits users and is inclusive and empathetic. The recommended books are:

1.  Mismatch: How Inclusion Shapes Design by Kat Holmes, which details how to approach tech from a mindful, inclusive, and empathetic place and provides a history of essential tools inspired by mismatches.
2.  Technically Wrong: Sexist Apps, Biased Algorithms, and Other Threats of Toxic Tech by Sara Wachter-Boettcher, which names and shames the times when user experiences made assumptions about users and provides examples of gauche, presumptive, and obtuse experiences.
3.  100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People by Susan M. Weinschenk, which explains the psychology behind human behavior and provides bite-sized lessons that teach how to design for user psychology.
4.  How to Meet WCAG (Quick Reference) by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2, which provides a quick and glanceable guide to designing content that can be enjoyed by everyone and meets users' most fundamental needs.

## Can you explain the UX area in simple terms?

Sure, I'd be happy to explain UX in simple terms!

User Experience (UX) refers to how people feel and interact with a product or service, such as a website, mobile app, or physical device. It involves understanding users' needs, behaviors, and emotions, and designing products that are intuitive, usable, and enjoyable to use.

UX designers work to create positive experiences for users by considering factors such as usability, accessibility, aesthetics, and functionality. They conduct research to understand users' needs and preferences, and use that information to create user flows, wireframes, and prototypes.

In short, UX is all about creating products that are easy and enjoyable to use, and that meet the needs of the people who use them.



The article highlights ten ways for product designers to use OpenAI's ChatGPT to enhance their efficiency. These include finding feature-specific inspiration, creating feature flow, explaining complex terms, understanding user requirements, discovering tools and websites, creating better prompts for AI image generators, creating design system documentation, getting ideas for design-related tasks, asking ChatGPT for help, and upskilling. The prompts are provided along with ChatGPT's responses to help designers get started. The author suggests using the results as a starting point and encourages readers to share their own prompts in the comments section.
