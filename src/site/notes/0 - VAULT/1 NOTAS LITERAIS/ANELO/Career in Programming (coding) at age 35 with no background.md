I saw this post in social media and want you to respond, with all your expertise on the subject, to the following: 

>Career in Programming/coding at age 35 with no background Hi, I am 35 and no where in my life. I have a college diploma in media arts which is basically some basic skills in photoshop and illustrator. I regret that should have chosen the development field when I was studying. I am at a stage where I need more income to feed my family and raise my kids. I am willing to learn coding. I have basic experience in html just to let you guys know what my level is about programming. Now I need help from you guys who can tell me how can I start this? What specific languages should I learn and master. How long can it all take to learn and get a nice beginner job. Do I need to go back to college or is there anything there I can do. Please help



It's great to hear that you are interested in learning coding and exploring new career opportunities at the age of 35. Here are some suggestions to get you started on this path:

1. Decide on your career goals: You should decide on what type of programming you want to do and what your career goals are. For instance, you could specialize in front-end development, back-end development, mobile app development, game development, or any other type of programming. Having a clear career goal will help you focus on the specific skills and languages you need to learn.

2. Choose a programming language to learn: Based on your career goals, you can choose a programming language to learn. Some popular programming languages for beginners are Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. These languages are easy to learn and widely used in different industries.

3. Learn through online courses and tutorials: You can learn programming online through various online courses, tutorials, and YouTube videos. These resources are available for free or for a small fee. Some popular platforms for online learning are Udemy, Coursera, edX, Codecademy, and Khan Academy.

4. Practice coding regularly: To become proficient in programming, you need to practice coding regularly. You can practice by solving coding challenges, building small projects, or contributing to open-source projects.

5. Build a portfolio: Once you have some programming skills, you should start building a portfolio of your projects. A portfolio will showcase your skills and help you stand out when applying for jobs.

6. Attend meetups and networking events: Attend local meetups and networking events to meet other programmers and learn about job opportunities in the field.

7. Consider a bootcamp or degree program: If you prefer a structured learning environment, you can consider attending a coding bootcamp or pursuing a degree program in computer science or a related field.

In terms of the time it takes to learn programming and get a job, it varies depending on your dedication, effort, and the job market in your area. With dedication and consistent practice, you can become proficient in programming within 6-12 months. However, it may take longer to get a job, especially if you have no prior experience in the field.

Lastly, you don't necessarily need to go back to college to pursue a career in programming. Many successful programmers have learned through self-study and online courses. However, a college degree can be helpful in certain job markets, and it may provide you with a broader education in computer science.

>can you change the point six for something that its helpful for people of arts and humanities that may be fright with the math aspect of coding?

Sure! For people who come from arts and humanities backgrounds and may feel intimidated by the math aspect of coding, here's an alternative point six:

6. Look for coding resources that emphasize visual and creative aspects: There are coding languages and resources that emphasize the visual and creative aspects of programming, which may be more accessible and engaging for people from arts and humanities backgrounds. For instance, Processing is a programming language and development environment designed for artists and designers, and it uses visual elements such as graphics and animation. Similarly, p5.js is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to create interactive graphics and animations for the web. These resources can help you learn to code in a way that is more familiar and appealing to your background.

Additionally, there are visual programming languages such as Scratch and Blockly that use block-based coding and drag-and-drop interfaces, which can be an excellent introduction to coding concepts without requiring as much math or typing. These resources can help you build up your confidence and skills in a more accessible way before moving on to more complex programming languages.

Remember, coding is a skill that requires practice and persistence, but with the right resources and approach, it can be an enjoyable and rewarding journey.
