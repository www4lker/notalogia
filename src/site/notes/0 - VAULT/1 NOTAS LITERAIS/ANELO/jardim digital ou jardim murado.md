#### Cons of making your Obsidian vault public as a digital garden:

-   Privacy concerns: depending on the content of your notes, you may have concerns about sharing certain information publicly.
-   Intellectual property concerns: sharing your ideas and knowledge publicly may make it easier for others to copy or plagiarize your work.

-   Potential for negative feedback or criticism: while feedback and engagement can be beneficial, it's also possible that negative feedback or criticism could be discouraging or demotivating.

#### Pros of keeping your Obsidian vault private as a resource for future books:

-   Intellectual property protection: keeping your notes private can help protect your ideas and knowledge from being copied or plagiarized by others.
-   More flexibility in terms of content: since your notes are not public-facing, you can explore more freely and potentially make mistakes without worrying about the public perception.

#### Cons of keeping your Obsidian vault private as a resource for future books:

-   Limited visibility and networking opportunities: by keeping your work private, you miss out on potential opportunities to collaborate and network with like-minded individuals.
-   Limited feedback and engagement: without sharing your ideas publicly, you may miss out on valuable feedback and engagement from others.
-   Potential for loss of motivation: without external motivation, it can be easy to lose motivation or direction in your work.
-   Potential for lack of accountability: without the accountability of a public audience, it can be easy to let the quality of your work slip.
