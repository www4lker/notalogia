>User Experience (UX) refers to how people feel and interact with a product or service, such as a website, mobile app, or physical device. It involves understanding users' needs, behaviors, and emotions, and designing products that are intuitive, usable, and enjoyable to use.

>UX designers work to create positive experiences for users by considering factors such as usability, accessibility, aesthetics, and functionality. They conduct research to understand users' needs and preferences, and use that information to create user flows, wireframes, and prototypes.

>In short, UX is all about creating products that are easy and enjoyable to use, and that meet the needs of the people who use them.
