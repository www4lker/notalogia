## Summary of key rules 

### Typographic considerations for body text:

1.  Point size:

-   Should be 10-12 points in printed documents
-   15-25 pixels on the web

2.  Line spacing:

-   Should be 120-145% of the point size

3.  Line length:

-   The average line length should be 45-90 characters (including spaces)

4.  Font:

-   Use a professional font, like those found in font recommendations
-   Avoid goofy fonts, monospaced fonts, most free fonts, and system fonts (especially Times New Roman and Arial)

### Other important typographic considerations:

5.  Quotation marks:

-   Use curly quotation marks, not straight ones

6.  Bold and italic:

-   Use as little as possible, and not together

7.  Underlining:

-   Never underline, except perhaps for web links

8.  All caps:

-   Fine for less than one line of text

9.  Centered text:

-   Use sparingly

10.  Spacing:

-   Put only one space between sentences
-   Don’t use multiple word spaces or other white-space characters in a row

11.  Small caps:

-   If you don’t have real small caps, don’t use them at all
-   Use 5-12% extra letterspacing with all caps and small caps

12.  Kerning:

-   Should always be turned on

13.  Indents:

-   Use first-line indents that are one to four times the point size of the text
-   Or use 4-10 points of space between paragraphs
-   Don’t use both

14.  Hyphenation:

-   Always use hyphenation with justified text
-   Don’t confuse hyphens and dashes
-   Don’t use multiple hyphens as a dash

15.  Ampersands:

-   Use sparingly, unless included in a proper name

16.  Trademark and copyright symbols:

-   Use proper symbols, not alphabetic approximations

17.  Exclamation points:

-   In a document longer than three pages, one exclamation point is plenty

18.  Nonbreaking space:

-   Put a nonbreaking space after paragraph and section marks

19.  Ellipses:

-   Make ellipses using the proper character, not periods and spaces

20.  Apostrophes and marks:

-   Apostrophes point downward
-   Make sure foot and inch marks are straight, not curly.
