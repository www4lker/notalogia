It is definitely possible for a beginner in Python to implement a scrabble board and multiplayer features. However, it might take some time and effort to learn and apply concepts required for these features.

For the scrabble board, you need to create a 2D array/grid to represent the board and handle the placing of words on the board. You'll also need to validate the word placement on the board (e.g., checking if the word is connected to existing words, if it fits on the board, etc.).

For multiplayer, you have a few options. If you want a local multiplayer, simply modify the game to take turns between players, store each player's score, and switch between player racks.

For online multiplayer, you'll need to be familiar with networking concepts, such as using sockets or implementing a client-server architecture. You can start learning these concepts by looking into Python's `socket` library and tutorials on networking in Python.

Remember, learning and implementing new concepts may take time, so be patient and break the project into smaller tasks. Good luck!

To create an ongoing online session for your Scrabble game similar to Wordle, you'll need to build a web application using a web framework and store user data such as progress and scores. Here are the steps to create an online Scrabble game with user sessions:

1. Choose a web framework: You can use a web framework like Flask or Django to build a web application in Python. Flask is simpler and recommended for beginners.

2. Create a web interface: Design and create the user interface (UI) for your game using HTML and CSS. You might also want to use JavaScript to handle user interactions and make the game more dynamic.

3. Implement game logic: Modify the existing Scrabble game code to work with the web application. This might involve changes to how the game takes inputs and displays the game state.

4. User authentication: Add user registration and login features. You can use built-in authentication libraries from your chosen web framework (e.g., Flask-Login for Flask) or third-party libraries like OAuth.

5. Store game data and sessions: Use a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) to store user data, game states, and scores. This will allow the server to remember user progress and data, even if the game is played over several days.

6. Implement IA (Intelligent Agent): Design an algorithm for the computer opponent (AI) that will play against the user. This may involve simple word generation or more advanced techniques like machine learning.

7. Deploy the web application: Host the game on a server using a hosting service like Heroku or Digital Ocean so it can be accessed from anywhere via a web browser.

This process may be challenging for a beginner, but it's rewarding as you'll learn many important concepts and tools along the way. Break the project into smaller tasks and tackle each one step-by-step, seeking help from tutorials, documentation, and online forums when needed. Good luck!

Of course! Here's a summary of what we've done so far:

1. We set up a Flask web application, which will serve as the back-end for our online Scrabble game.
   - This includes creating an "app.py" file and initializing the Flask app.

2. We created a route ('/') in the "app.py" file to serve the web interface (HTML template) for the game.
   - This route renders the "index.html" file that contains the designed Scrabble board layout.

3. We set up a directory structure to organize the project, with separate "templates" and "static" folders.
   - The "index.html" (and any other HTML templates) should be stored in the "templates" folder.
   - CSS and JavaScript files should be stored in the "static" folder.

4. We added code to handle user interaction (e.g., clicking on a square) using JavaScript.
   - We created a JavaScript function (e.g., `squareClicked(row, col)`) that gets triggered when the user clicks on a square. This function will be responsible for handling user input and updating the UI.

5. We separated the existing Scrabble game logic into a separate Python file (e.g., "scrabble.py").
   - This file contains all the game-related functions, such as `initialize_rack` and `calculate_score`.

6. We started modifying the game logic to work with the web application, mainly by using AJAX requests to send user input (e.g., input word and starting square) to the Flask app and updating the game state in response.

Here, we are essentially building a client-server architecture for the web-based Scrabble game. The client (browser) handles the user interface and user interactions, while the server (Flask app) processes the game logic and maintains the game state. The two sides communicate via HTTP requests (e.g., AJAX requests) to exchange game information and update the game state.

Moving forward, the focus should be on implementing and refining the game logic functions in "scrabble.py", connecting them with the Flask routes in "app.py", and updating the game state and UI using JavaScript.
