In this transcription, the speaker shares six principles for learning to code in 2023, emphasizing that it's a great time to learn coding despite AI advancements and economic challenges. The six principles are:

1.  Pick your focus: Instead of trying to learn everything, choose a specific area or language to master, such as Python or back-end development.
2.  Learn how to learn: Develop effective learning strategies based on neuroscience to learn faster and more efficiently.
3.  Be practical: Apply the skills you learn in projects to avoid getting stuck in a cycle of watching tutorials without retaining information.
4.  Don't be a monkey coder: Stay relevant by understanding software architecture, design principles, and computer architecture to avoid being replaced by automation.
5.  Use AI to your advantage: Embrace AI, learn its basics, and use tools like GPT to help solve coding problems and build portfolio projects.
6.  Improve communication skills: Being a good software engineer requires excellent communication skills, so focus on building trust, cooperation, and persuasion abilities.

Additionally, the speaker recommends various Coursera courses and a free online computer science degree template to help learn coding effectively.
