As a private English teacher for foreign programmers, I would prioritize grammar rules that are essential for effective communication. Here are some key grammar rules to focus on:

1.  Sentence Structure: Teach students how to construct simple, compound, and complex sentences using subjects, verbs, and objects. Ensure they understand the proper word order for affirmative, negative, and interrogative sentences.
    
2.  Verb Tenses: Make sure students have a strong grasp of verb tenses, including simple present, simple past, simple future, present continuous, past continuous, future continuous, present perfect, past perfect, and future perfect. This will help them accurately convey actions and events in time.
    
3.  Subject-Verb Agreement: Teach students to match the subject of a sentence with the correct verb form, paying attention to singular and plural forms.
    
4.  Articles: Explain the correct usage of definite (the) and indefinite (a, an) articles, as well as when to use no article at all.
    
5.  Prepositions: Help students understand the correct use of prepositions, such as in, on, at, for, and with, to convey relationships between words in a sentence.
    
6.  Pronouns: Teach the proper usage of pronouns (I, you, he, she, it, we, they), including subject, object, possessive, and reflexive pronouns, as well as relative pronouns (who, which, that).
    
7.  Modals: Ensure students understand how to use modal verbs (can, could, will, would, should, may, might, must) to express possibility, ability, permission, requests, and advice.
    
8.  Conditionals: Help students grasp the structure and usage of the zero, first, second, and third conditionals for expressing hypothetical situations, consequences, and possibilities.
    
9.  Passive Voice: Teach students how to form and use the passive voice when the focus is on the action rather than the doer of the action.
    
10.  Conjunctions: Help students understand how to use coordinating (and, but, or, so, for, yet, nor) and subordinating (although, because, if, since, when, etc.) conjunctions to connect ideas, phrases, and clauses.
    

By prioritizing these grammar rules, you will help your foreign programmer students develop a solid foundation in English, enabling them to communicate effectively in both professional and casual settings.
