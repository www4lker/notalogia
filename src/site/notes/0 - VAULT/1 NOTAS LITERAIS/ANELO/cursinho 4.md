>If you were a private teacher in an English course for foreign programmers, how would you teach reading comprehension, i.e., help your students to read and understand English texts related to programming, such as API documentation, tutorials, manuals, among others?

As a private English teacher for foreign programmers, teaching reading comprehension for programming-related texts is essential. Here are some strategies you can use to help your students read and understand English texts related to programming:

1.  Pre-reading activities: Before reading a text, discuss the topic and any relevant vocabulary to activate students' prior knowledge and prepare them for the content. For example, if you're reading about web development, discuss related terms like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    
2.  Teach reading strategies: Teach students various strategies to improve their reading comprehension, such as skimming, scanning, predicting, and inferring. Encourage students to use these strategies while reading programming-related texts.
    
3.  Teach technical vocabulary: Focus on teaching technical vocabulary that is specific to programming, such as terms related to data structures, algorithms, and programming languages. Help students understand the meaning and usage of these terms in context.
    
4.  Break down complex sentences: Some programming texts may contain complex sentences or jargon. Teach students how to break down these sentences into smaller parts and identify the main ideas, supporting details, and relationships between the ideas.
    
5.  Practice with diverse materials: Expose students to a variety of programming-related texts, such as API documentation, tutorials, manuals, blog posts, and forum discussions. This will help them become familiar with different writing styles and formats.
    
6.  Teach text structures: Explain common structures found in technical texts, such as problem-solution, cause-effect, and chronological order. Help students recognize these structures and use them to better understand the content.
    
7.  Active reading: Encourage students to take notes, underline, or highlight important information while reading. This active engagement with the text can improve comprehension.
    
8.  Use comprehension questions: After reading a text, ask students questions that assess their understanding of the content. Questions can range from basic recall to more complex analysis and evaluation.
    
9.  Encourage peer discussion: Have students discuss programming-related texts with their peers, sharing their understanding and interpretations. This can help clarify concepts and deepen comprehension.
    
10.  Practice reading code: Encourage students to read code samples in addition to written texts. Help them understand how to interpret the code and identify the purpose of different sections.
    

By using these strategies and providing ample opportunities for practice, you can help your foreign programmer students develop the necessary reading comprehension skills to effectively understand programming-related English texts.
