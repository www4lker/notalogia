# describe your code of conduct


Creating a code of conduct for your GitHub project helps establish guidelines and expectations for participants' behavior and ensures a respectful and inclusive environment. Here's a simplified guide on how to create a code of conduct in GitHub:

1. Choose a code of conduct: There are several widely recognized and commonly used code of conduct templates available. One popular option is the Contributor Covenant (https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), which provides a comprehensive code of conduct template. You can also find other templates suited to your project's specific needs.

2. Create a new file: In your GitHub repository, navigate to the main page and click on the "Add file" button. Choose the option to "Create new file."

3. Name the file: Enter a descriptive name for the file, such as "CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" or "CONTRIBUTING.md." It's recommended to use the ".md" extension, which stands for Markdown, as it allows for easy formatting.

4. Copy and paste the code of conduct: Open the code of conduct template you have chosen in a text editor. Copy the entire content of the template.

5. Paste the code of conduct: Go back to GitHub and paste the code of conduct content into the new file you created. Ensure the formatting is preserved by selecting the "Preview" tab to verify the file's appearance.

6. Commit the changes: Scroll down to the "Commit new file" section. Enter a meaningful commit message that describes the addition of the code of conduct file. For example, "Add code of conduct" or "Create CONTRIBUTING.md." Optionally, you can provide a more detailed description of the changes made.

7. Commit the changes: Click the "Commit new file" button to save the code of conduct file to your repository.

8. Display the code of conduct: To make the code of conduct visible and easily accessible, you can add a link to it in your repository's README.md file or create a dedicated section on your project's website or documentation.

9. Communicate the code of conduct: Inform your contributors, community, and new participants about the existence of the code of conduct. Make it clear that everyone is expected to adhere to it when engaging with the project. You can mention it in your README file, project documentation, or any other communication channels related to your project.

10. Enforce the code of conduct: Actively monitor and address any reported violations or instances where the code of conduct is not respected. Respond promptly and appropriately to maintain a positive and inclusive community.

Remember that the code of conduct is a living document that can be refined and improved over time. Encourage feedback from the community and be open to revising and evolving the code of conduct to meet the needs of your project and its participants.
