If you were a private teacher in an English course for foreign programmers, what programming-specific vocabulary would you prioritize to teach?

As a private English teacher for foreign programmers, I would prioritize teaching programming-specific vocabulary that is commonly used and essential for understanding programming concepts. Here is a list of vocabulary terms I would emphasize:

1.  Algorithm: A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task.
2.  Variable: A symbolic name for a value that can change during program execution.
3.  Data Types: Categories of data, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans.
4.  Function: A named sequence of instructions that takes input, performs a specific task, and returns output.
5.  Conditional Statements: If, else, and elif statements that control the flow of a program based on certain conditions.
6.  Loops: For and while loops that allow for repeated execution of a block of code.
7.  Array: A data structure that stores a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same data type.
8.  Object: An instance of a class that encapsulates data and methods related to that data.
9.  Class: A blueprint for creating objects with specific properties and methods.
10.  Inheritance: A mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from a parent class.
11.  Interface: A collection of abstract methods that a class can implement.
12.  Exception Handling: Techniques for handling runtime errors, such as try, catch, and finally blocks.
13.  Library: A collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform common tasks.
14.  API (Application Programming Interface): A set of rules and protocols that allows software components to communicate with each other.
15.  Syntax: The set of rules governing the structure of a programming language.
16.  Compiler: A program that translates source code from a high-level language into a lower-level language, typically machine code.
17.  Debugging: The process of identifying and resolving errors in a program.
18.  Version Control: A system for tracking changes to files, such as Git.
19.  Integrated Development Environment (IDE): A software application that provides comprehensive tools for programming, including a code editor, debugger, and compiler.

These terms represent some of the most essential concepts in programming, and teaching these words will help foreign programmers improve their understanding and communication within the field.
