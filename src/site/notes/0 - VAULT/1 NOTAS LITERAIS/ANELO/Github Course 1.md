GitHub Pages is a feature provided by the popular code hosting platform called GitHub. It allows you to create and host a website for free using the repositories on GitHub.

Imagine you have a collection of code files or web pages stored in a repository on GitHub. GitHub Pages lets you easily turn that code or web pages into a live website that anyone can visit on the internet.

When you enable GitHub Pages for a repository, GitHub takes the files from that repository and automatically turns them into a website. It uses a specific branch called the "gh-pages" branch to build and publish the website. You can choose to use either a custom domain (like www.yourwebsite.com) or a default domain provided by GitHub (like yourusername.github.io) to access your website.

GitHub Pages is commonly used by developers to showcase their projects, documentation, personal websites, or even host blogs. It's a simple and convenient way to share your work with others without the need for complex web hosting setups or costs.

Once your website is set up with GitHub Pages, you can update and modify the code or web pages in your repository, and GitHub will automatically rebuild and update the website. This allows you to easily maintain and make changes to your website over time.

Overall, GitHub Pages is a user-friendly service that leverages the power of GitHub to help you create and host websites quickly and easily, making it accessible to a wide audience on the internet.

CNAME stands for "Canonical Name." In simple terms, it is a record used in the Domain Name System (DNS) that helps redirect one domain name to another domain name.

Imagine you have a website with a long and complicated domain name like "www.example.com." You might want to create a shorter and more memorable domain name like "mywebsite.com" and have it point to the same website. This is where CNAME comes in.

By setting up a CNAME record, you can tell the DNS that "mywebsite.com" is just another name for "www.example.com." When someone types "mywebsite.com" in their web browser, the DNS looks up the CNAME record and sees the connection to "www.example.com." It then redirects the user to the correct website.

CNAME records are handy when you want to create alternative or custom domain names for your website without changing the actual content or location of the website itself. It allows you to have multiple domain names pointing to the same website, which can be useful for branding, marketing, or making your website more accessible.

Setting up a CNAME record usually involves accessing your domain registrar or DNS management system and specifying the desired alias (the new domain name) and the canonical name (the existing domain name). Once the CNAME record is configured correctly, the DNS will handle the redirection automatically.

In summary, a CNAME record is a DNS configuration that lets you associate one domain name with another. It helps create shorter, more memorable domain names that point to the same website, making it easier for users to access your web content.
