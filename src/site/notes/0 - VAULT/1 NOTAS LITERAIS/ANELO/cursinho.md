### Bônus Content

#### quanto tempo de duração deveria ter o cursinho?
When designing an English course for foreign programmers catering to both complete beginners and those with a reasonable command of English, it's important to create separate courses tailored to each group's needs. Here's a suggested timeline for the courses:

1. Complete beginners:
For students with zero knowledge of English, you'll need to start with basic English language skills before introducing programming-specific vocabulary and concepts. A typical beginner course might span around 6 months, assuming classes are held 2-3 times a week, each lasting 1-2 hours. This duration could be shorter or longer depending on the students' learning pace, class frequency, and the intensity of the course.

2. Intermediate students (with reasonable English knowledge):
For students who already know English reasonably well but lack programming-specific language skills, a shorter course focused on technical vocabulary, jargon, and relevant communication skills would be more appropriate. This course could be designed to last around 2-3 months, assuming the same class frequency and duration as the beginner course. However, this timeline may also vary depending on students' progress and the depth of programming-related content covered.

For a Brazilian audience, it would be essential to consider the specific challenges Portuguese speakers might face when learning English, such as pronunciation, grammar differences, and false cognates. Additionally, incorporating Brazilian cultural context and examples into the course content can make it more relatable and engaging for the students.

Ultimately, the actual duration of the courses may vary based on several factors, including the curriculum, the students' learning pace, the teacher's approach, and the amount of practice and reinforcement provided. Regular assessments can help gauge students' progress and determine if any adjustments to the timeline or curriculum are needed.

#### Quanto deveria custar?

>How much should this course cost: - if it is face-to-face (which means paying rent for a place and having to pay for air conditioning) - if it is exclusively online include the costs of online marketing

Determining the cost of an English course for foreign programmers depends on various factors, such as location, class size, instructor qualifications, course duration, and materials. To give a rough estimate of the course fees, let's consider the following scenarios:

1.  Face-to-face course:

-   Rent: The cost of renting a space for classes will vary depending on the location and size of the facility. Research local rental rates to get an accurate estimate. For example, if the monthly rent for an appropriate space is $1,000 and the course lasts 6 months, the total rent cost would be $6,000.
    
-   Utilities: Include the cost of utilities such as electricity, water, and air conditioning. These costs can vary, so research average utility rates in your area. For example, if utilities cost around $200 per month, the total utilities cost for a 6-month course would be $1,200.
    
-   Instructor fees: The cost of hiring a qualified instructor will depend on their experience and qualifications. For example, if you pay an instructor $30 per hour and hold 2-hour classes three times a week for 6 months (approximately 26 weeks), the total instructor fees would be $4,680.
    
-   Marketing: For online marketing, consider costs related to running ads on platforms like Google Ads or social media, as well as creating and maintaining a website. This can vary widely, but let's assume a budget of $1,000 for the entire course duration.
    
-   Additional costs: Consider any additional costs, such as teaching materials, equipment, insurance, or administrative expenses. For example, if these costs amount to $1,000 for the course duration, factor that into your overall cost calculation.
    

In this example, the total cost for a 6-month face-to-face course would be approximately $13,880. If you plan to have 10 students, the course fee per student would be around $1,388.

2.  Exclusively online course:

-   Instructor fees: Assuming the same instructor fees as the face-to-face course, the total instructor fees would be $4,680.
    
-   Technology expenses: Account for the cost of online platforms, such as a Learning Management System (LMS), video conferencing tools, or other digital resources. For example, if these costs amount to $500 for the course duration, include that in your cost calculation.
    
-   Marketing: The marketing budget might be similar to the face-to-face course. In this case, we'll assume the same $1,000 budget.
    
-   Additional costs: Online courses may have different additional costs, such as producing video lessons or designing digital materials. For example, if these costs amount to $800 for the course duration, factor that into your overall cost calculation.
    

In this example, the total cost for a 6-month online course would be approximately $6,980. If you plan to have 10 students, the course fee per student would be around $698.

Please note that these are rough estimates and may not accurately reflect the actual costs in your specific situation. It's crucial to research local costs, instructor fees, and marketing expenses to create a more accurate pricing structure for your course.

##### como ensinar a se destacar em entrevista

Expanding on item 4, "Preparing for job interviews," here's a more detailed breakdown of how you could teach this essential skill to your students:

1.  Research the company: Teach students the importance of researching the company they are interviewing with. Explain how understanding the company's mission, values, products/services, and recent news can help them make a better impression and tailor their responses during the interview. Discuss various research methods, such as reviewing the company website, reading news articles, and following the company on social media.
    
2.  Understand the job requirements: Help students analyze job descriptions to identify key skills, responsibilities, and qualifications required for the role. Teach them to match their own skills and experience with these requirements and to be prepared to discuss how they meet or exceed them during the interview.
    
3.  Anticipate interview questions: Discuss common interview questions and how to approach them. Divide questions into categories, such as general (e.g., "Tell me about yourself"), technical (programming-specific questions or problem-solving tasks), behavioral (e.g., "Describe a time when you had to work in a team to complete a project"), and situational (e.g., "How would you handle a disagreement with a colleague?"). Provide examples of strong and weak responses to help students understand the best way to answer these questions.
    
4.  Practice the STAR method: Teach students the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for structuring their responses to behavioral and situational questions. This technique helps them provide clear and concise answers that demonstrate their skills and experience effectively.
    
5.  Prepare questions to ask the interviewer: Encourage students to prepare thoughtful questions to ask the interviewer about the company, team, or role. Explain that asking relevant questions shows genuine interest and engagement.
    
6.  Develop a strong elevator pitch: Help students create a brief, engaging summary of their background, skills, and career goals that they can use to introduce themselves during interviews. This "elevator pitch" should be tailored to the specific job and company they are interviewing for.
    
7.  Work on non-verbal communication: Teach students the importance of non-verbal communication during interviews, such as maintaining eye contact, exhibiting positive body language, and practicing active listening.
    
8.  Address language barriers: For non-native English speakers, discuss strategies for handling language barriers during interviews, such as asking for clarification, speaking slowly and clearly, and being honest about their language proficiency.
    
9.  Mock interviews: Organize mock interviews where students can practice their responses to interview questions and receive feedback from the instructor and their peers. This helps students build confidence and refine their interview skills.
    

By covering these aspects of job interview preparation, you can equip your foreign programmer students with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in interviews with foreign companies that accept English speakers.
