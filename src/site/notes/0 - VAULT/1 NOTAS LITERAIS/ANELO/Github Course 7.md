# how can i be warned about security issues?

To set up your GitHub repository to receive security alerts and warnings about potential vulnerabilities, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your repository: Open the repository on GitHub for which you want to enable security alerts.

2. Go to the "Settings" tab: On the repository page, locate the "Settings" tab, usually located at the top-right portion of the page. Click on it to access the repository settings.

3. Select "Security & analysis" in the left sidebar: In the settings sidebar, scroll down and click on "Security & analysis" under the "Features" section.

4. Enable "Dependency graph" and "Security alerts": On the Security & analysis page, you'll see an option to enable the "Dependency graph" and "Security alerts." Click on the checkboxes or toggle buttons to activate these features.

5. Choose security alert delivery options: GitHub offers different ways to receive security alerts. You can select from the following options:

   - **Automatically generated pull requests**: This option automatically opens pull requests to update vulnerable dependencies with the latest security patches.
   - **Email**: You can choose to receive security alerts via email.
   - **Web notifications**: GitHub can notify you about security alerts through web notifications.

   Select the desired delivery options by checking the corresponding checkboxes or toggling the buttons.

6. Save the changes: Once you have enabled the desired security alert settings, click on the "Save changes" button to apply them.

7. Respond to security alerts: GitHub will now actively scan your repository's dependencies for known vulnerabilities. If any security issues are detected, you will receive alerts through the selected delivery channels. It's important to promptly review and address these alerts by updating your dependencies to versions that include security fixes.

By following these steps, you can set up your GitHub repository to receive security alerts and be notified about potential vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies. This helps you stay aware of security risks and take necessary actions to keep your project secure.
