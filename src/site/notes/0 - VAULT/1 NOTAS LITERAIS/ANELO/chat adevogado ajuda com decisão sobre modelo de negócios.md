>And which model is simplest to apply under the following conditions:
	1. the house is part of a legal dispute
	2. the house in question is in another city, far from the owner 
	3. the owner of the house in question is interested in selling the house
	4. the house is big and located in a central area of the city, which increases its value
	5. the owner of the house has no contacts or acquaintances in the city where the house is, and needs to rent it out urgently


Under the given conditions, it might be simpler to apply the traditional rental format for the following reasons:

1. Legal dispute: While the house is part of a legal dispute, it might be challenging to attract short-term, on-demand tenants who are looking for a hassle-free rental experience. Long-term tenants may be more understanding and willing to work with the landlord under these circumstances.

2. Remote location of the owner: Since the owner lives far from the property, managing an on-demand rental requires more effort, such as frequent communication with tenants, handling check-ins and check-outs, and managing tenant turnover. A traditional long-term rental would require less hands-on management.

3. Interest in selling the house: If the owner is interested in selling the house, having a long-term tenant in place could potentially make the property more attractive to potential buyers, as it demonstrates a stable rental income. Additionally, it may be easier to schedule property viewings with a long-term tenant rather than coordinating with multiple short-term tenants.

4. Property size and location: A big house in a central area of the city might be more appealing to long-term tenants, such as families or professionals, who are looking for stability and convenience in their living situation.

5. Lack of contacts in the city: Since the owner has no contacts or acquaintances in the city and needs to rent out the house urgently, it might be more time-efficient to find a long-term tenant who can provide a stable rental income, rather than spending time and effort managing an on-demand rental.

However, it's essential for the owner to consider hiring a property management company or a local real estate agent to assist with the rental process, given their remote location and lack of contacts in the city. This could help ensure a smoother experience for both the owner and the tenant, regardless of the chosen rental format.
