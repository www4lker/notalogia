>I keep meeting people out in the world who want to get into this industry. Some have even gone to coding boot camp. They did all the exercises. They tell me about their React apps and their Rails APIs and their page design skills. They’ve spent their money and time to gain access to the global economy in short order, and often it hasn’t worked.

>I offer my card, promise to answer their emails. It is my responsibility. We need to get more people into this industry.

>But I also see them asking, with their eyes, “Why not me?”

>And here I squirm and twist. _Because—because we have judged you and found you wanting_. Because you do not speak with a confident cadence, because you cannot show us how to balance a binary tree on a whiteboard, because you overlabored the difference between UI and UX, because you do not light up in the way that we light up when hearing about some obscure bug, some bad button, the latest bit of outrageousness on Hacker News. Because the things you learned are already, six months later, not exactly what we need. Because the industry is still overlorded by people like me, who were lucky enough to have learned the etiquette early, to even know there _was_ an etiquette.

>I try to do better, and so does my company. How do you change an industry that will not stop, not even to catch its breath? We have no leaders, no elections. We never expected to take over the world! It was just a scene. You know how U2 was a little band in Ireland with some good albums, and over time grew into this huge, world-spanning band-as-brand with stadium shows with giant robotic structures, and Bono was hanging out with Paul Wolfowitz? Tech is like that, but it just kept going. Imagine if you were really into the group Swervedriver in the mid-’90s but by 2019 someone was on CNBC telling you that Swervedriver represented, I don’t know, 10 percent of global economic growth, outpacing returns in oil and lumber. That’s the tech industry.

>No one loves tech for tech’s sake. All of this was about power—power over the way stories were told, the ability to say things on my own terms. The aesthetic of technology is an aesthetic of power—CPU speed, sure, but what do you think we’re talking about when we talk about “design”? That’s just a proxy for power; design is about control, about presenting the menu to others and saying, “These are the options you wanted. _I’m sorry if you wanted a roast beef sandwich, but sir, this is not an Arby’s_.” That is Apple’s secret: It commoditizes the power of a computer and sells it to you as design.

>Technology is a whole world that looks nothing like the world it seeks to command. A white world, a male world, and—it breaks my heart to say it, for I’ve been to a lot of Meetups ([now a WeWork company](https://www.wired.com/story/why-wework-is-buying-meetup/)), and hosted some too—a lonely world. Maybe I’m just projecting some teenage metaphysics onto a lively and dynamic system, but I can’t fully back away from that sense of monolithic loneliness. We’re like a carpenter who spent so long perfecting his tools that he forgot to build the church.

In today's fast-paced world, the technology industry is constantly evolving, and it can be challenging for aspiring professionals to break into it. Many people spend their time and money attending coding boot camps and learning various programming languages and design skills, only to find that their efforts have not paid off. It's disheartening to see these individuals questioning why they haven't succeeded when they have put in so much effort.

One of the reasons for this struggle is the industry's ever-changing demand for specific skills and knowledge. What someone learns today may not be relevant or applicable six months down the line. Additionally, the tech industry is still largely dominated by those who had the privilege of learning the ropes early on and understanding the unwritten rules and etiquette.

The responsibility to help newcomers lies with those who are already established in the industry. By offering guidance, mentorship, and support, we can help bridge the gap and create a more inclusive environment.

However, changing the industry is no easy task. The tech world has grown exponentially, and it now represents a significant portion of the global economy. What was once just a niche interest has become a powerful force that affects almost every aspect of our lives. This rapid growth has led to an emphasis on power and control, with design and aesthetics often being used as a proxy for these concepts.

The technology industry, as it stands today, is predominantly white and male. This lack of diversity contributes to a sense of loneliness and isolation for many who are trying to break into the field. It is essential to recognize and address this issue if we want to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for aspiring tech professionals.

As we move forward, we must question the ideologies that have shaped the industry thus far. The celebration of disruption, the belief in the power of digital platforms to uphold free speech regardless of its content, the faith in the singularity, and the idea that software will eventually consume the world – all of these ideas are being challenged as the industry continues to evolve.

It's crucial for those within the technology industry to take a step back and reassess the values and beliefs that have brought us to this point. By doing so, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and diverse space that welcomes newcomers, encourages innovation, and ultimately leads to a better future for all.

In conclusion, the technology industry is constantly evolving, and it can be challenging for aspiring professionals to break into it. Established professionals have a responsibility to guide and mentor newcomers, helping them navigate the ever-changing landscape of the industry. By reassessing the values and ideologies that have shaped the industry thus far, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and diverse environment that fosters innovation and growth.

It is essential to recognize the challenges that newcomers face and work to address them, whether it be through mentorship, support, or changing the industry's culture. By doing so, we can help ensure that the technology industry remains a driving force in the global economy and a space where all individuals, regardless of their background or experience, have the opportunity to succeed and make a difference.
