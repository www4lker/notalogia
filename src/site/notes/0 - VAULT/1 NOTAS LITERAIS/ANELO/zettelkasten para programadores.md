The author shares their experience of using a Zettelkasten, specifically Obsidian, to improve their coding knowledge. They structure their Zettelkasten into four folders, Bibliography, Fleeting Notes, Permanent Notes, and Templates. The author finds the Permanent Notes folder particularly useful and creates notes using a template with a title, body of note, and related links. Each permanent note should be atomic and written in their own words. The author recommends explaining concepts in layman's terms to better understand them and leaving links to topics that require further research. The Zettelkasten process helps them learn more than they ever anticipated.
