# how to get support


To provide guidance to users on how to get help with the code in your GitHub repository, you can utilize the SUPPORT configuration file. The SUPPORT file allows you to specify the appropriate channels for users to seek assistance, such as community forums, issue trackers, or documentation. Here's how you can set it up:

1. Create a new file: In your GitHub repository, navigate to the main page and click on the "Add file" button. Choose the option to "Create new file".

2. Name the file: Enter "SUPPORT" as the file name. The file should be named exactly as "SUPPORT" without any extension.

3. Add content: In the file, provide instructions on how users can seek help for your repository. Here are a few examples of what you can include:

   - Links to documentation: If you have documentation or a user guide, provide the links to relevant resources where users can find answers to common questions or troubleshoot issues themselves.

   - Issue tracker: If you have an issue tracker, provide instructions on how users can submit bug reports, feature requests, or general inquiries. Specify any guidelines or templates to follow when creating new issues.

   - Community forums: If you have a community forum or a dedicated discussion platform, provide a link and instructions for users to join the community and seek help or engage in discussions.

   - Communication channels: If you have specific communication channels such as a mailing list, Slack workspace, or Discord server, mention them and explain how users can join and interact with the community.

   Customize the content based on the available support options you have for your repository. Make it clear and concise, ensuring that users can easily understand how to get help.

4. Commit the changes: Scroll down to the "Commit new file" section. Enter a meaningful commit message that describes the addition of the SUPPORT file. For example, "Add SUPPORT file to provide assistance guidelines".

5. Commit the changes: Click the "Commit new file" button to save the SUPPORT file to your repository.

By setting up the SUPPORT file, you provide clear instructions to users on where and how they can seek help with the code in your repository. It helps users find the appropriate resources and channels, reducing confusion and ensuring efficient communication and support.
