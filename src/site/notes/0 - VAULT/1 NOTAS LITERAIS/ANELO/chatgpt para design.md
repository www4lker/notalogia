>The article highlights ten ways for product designers to use OpenAI's ChatGPT to enhance their efficiency. These include finding feature-specific inspiration, creating feature flow, explaining complex terms, understanding user requirements, discovering tools and websites, creating better prompts for AI image generators, creating design system documentation, getting ideas for design-related tasks, asking ChatGPT for help, and upskilling. The prompts are provided along with ChatGPT's responses to help designers get started. The author suggests using the results as a starting point and encourages readers to share their own prompts in the comments section.

*Can you explain each one, giving some probable prompts?*
