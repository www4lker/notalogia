#  25 GitHub Configuration Files You Should Be Using

>You may know GitHub, but how well do you really _know_ GitHub? There are a lot of magic files in the GitHub ecosystem that need to have the right name and be stored in the right location to be used. The things they do are super useful, and everyone should know about them. Yet, most of GitHub’s 80 million users aren't aware of these powerful configuration files. In this course, Rob Bos details 25 hidden configuration files that can make your GitHub setup better and easier to maintain. Rob covers topics that range from the different README configurations, GitHub actions configuration, GitHub advanced security configurations, and more. He moves through each file, shows how to use them, and provides before and after files for each configuration so that you can follow along.
